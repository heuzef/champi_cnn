We are in the midst of an autumnal flush of spring/summer boletes, and on this same day I found T. alboater and quantities of plumbeoviolaceus, B. variipes and (under spruce) chippewaensis/edulis, Aur. innixus, vermiculosoides and subvelutipes, plus other common species. Also some Hen of the Woods that are more appropriate to the time of year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMycelium was white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCap flesh was yellow in the stipe and a yellow pale enough to approach white in the caps.
