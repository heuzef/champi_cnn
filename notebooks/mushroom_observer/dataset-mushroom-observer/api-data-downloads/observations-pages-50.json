But with the clamps, and the colors, and esp. the width of the spores, as only 4.6 um, this comes out at Ramaria rubricarnata var. verna in the Pacific NW Ramaria book.

I knew I had looked at it under the scope before, but didn\u0026#8217;t really get anywhere with it, and giving the amount of good info on Tubaria, not sure it would go anywhere.  But the cap is cellular, and if you say it is a Flammulaster because of that, then check in Funga Nordica at least, you can get somewhere, kinda.  These look fairly good for F. rhombosporus, with the somewhat angular, pointed spores.

Reyes, and I have also collected it from Salt Pt.  Identification for the first two collections was made by Hal Burdshall.  At the time we called it Syntinostroma aff. odoratum.  The generic identification is based on the distinctive dextrinoid skeletal hyphae.  The species ID was due primarily do to the lack of clamp connections and the spore size.  In looking more closely at the description of odoratum the color of our material seems too yellow, as S. odoratum is supposed to be cream colored to \u0026#8220;yellow ochraceous\u0026#8221;.    The spores of our material are also a bit too  fat, 8.6-10.1 X 5.8-6.4 vs. 7-9 X 3.5-5 for odoratum and a bit too short for S. ochraleucum (10-14 X 5-8), which is also not described as this yellow.  I think it might be closer to this latter species through, based on the cystidia. There are some species described from North America that I have not checked yet.

Now here\u0026#8217;s a little problem \u0026#8211; all three turned out to be quite different. Unfortunately I only saved dried cap sections for #1 and #2, so I couldn\u0026#8217;t examine their stipes (not that I\u0026#8217;d intended to do that initially, because P. cervinus is a role model for BUMs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.

Its stipe is also dull white with browner, velvety-looking base. Its cheilocystidia are way more numerous and they\u0026#8217;re slightly pigmented \u0026#8211; see \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/63845\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobservation 63845\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. The third one is a classic, boring P. cervinus (lol), dull dingy brown and otherwise plain, growing on a rotting birch log which is also standard. The problem is, there are some clamp connections in the pileipellis and they\u0026#8217;re outrageously abundant in the stipe hyphae.

Ca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morphology and appearance of A.parasiticus and A. flavus are very similar so it is difficult to distinguish them without an oil immersion microscope lens to view the spores. The spores of A. parasiticus are more echinulated (spiny) than A. flavus. Chemotaxonomy is a more reliable way of distinguishing the two species. First run a thin layer chromatography plate to separate the toxins and then view it under a black light. A. parasiticus always makes 2 green spots indicating aflatoxins G1 \u0026amp; G2 plus two 2 blue-green spots indicating aflatoxins B1 \u0026amp; B2. Aspergillus flavus may or may not produce B1 \u0026amp; B2 spots and no G spots because less than half of A. flavus isolates found are atoxigenic which has led to the development of a biocontrol method by USDA researcher, Peter Cotty, of finding very aggressive strains of atoxigenic A. flavus to grow in mass culture and spread over field crops with toxigenic strain problems. He has found good results from the aggressive atoxigenic strains out competing the toxigenic ones in field trials thus reducing the levels of aflatoxin contamination in the crop.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":354,"consensus_id":16630,"consensus_name":"Aspergillus flavus","location_id":15986,"location_name":"USDA, ARS, Western Regional Research Center, Albany, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":135920},{"id":63971,"type":"observation","date":"2011-02-26","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.837088,"created_at":"2011-02-28T14:24:08.000Z","updated_at":"2011-02-28T14:40:50.000Z","number_of_views":83,"last_viewed":"2024-03-06T07:15:35.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eIs it the same as my previous observation.. \u003ca href=\"http://mushroomobserver.org/57744?q=3kYE\"\u003ehttp://mushroomobserver.org/57744?q=3kYE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe light colored one is growing on a rock and the green one on a conifer.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2186,"consensus_id":873,"consensus_name":"Ramalina","location_id":959,"location_name":"Kalatope wildlife Sanctuary, Dalhousie, Himachal Pradesh, India","primary_image_id":135923},{"id":63972,"type":"observation","date":"2010-11-05","latitude":"46.33424","longitude":"13.53092","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.73314,"created_at":"2011-02-28T14:40:45.000Z","updated_at":"2012-02-23T21:53:13.000Z","number_of_views":60,"last_viewed":"2023-07-30T07:25:29.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eCode: Bot_474/2010_IMG3174\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHabitat: mixed woodland, nearly flat ground, cretaceous clastic rock (flysh), partly protected from direct rain,  mostly in shade, precipitations ~3.000 mm/year, average temperature 8-10 deg C, altitude 430 m (1.400 feet), alpine phytogeographical region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubstratum: fallen and partly rotten trunk of a hardwood tree, probably Carpinus betulus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlace: Bovec basin, west of Bovec, near the trail to Plužna village, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia EC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments: several fruitbodies, pileus width up to 6 cm (2.3 inch), SP white, flesh flexible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCanon G11, 6.1-30mm/f2.8-4.5\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":22043,"consensus_name":"Sarcomyxa serotina","location_id":673,"location_name":"Bovec basin, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":135924},{"id":63973,"type":"observation","date":"2011-02-27","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.837115,"created_at":"2011-02-28T14:55:07.000Z","updated_at":"2011-02-28T14:55:10.000Z","number_of_views":44,"last_viewed":"2023-11-03T01:54:34.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003ea yellow morel or is it a grey..??\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2186,"consensus_id":836,"consensus_name":"Morchella","location_id":959,"location_name":"Kalatope wildlife Sanctuary, Dalhousie, Himachal Pradesh, India","primary_image_id":135936},{"id":63974,"type":"observation","date":"2010-11-21","latitude":"46.32981","longitude":"13.69049","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.80407,"created_at":"2011-02-28T15:26:13.000Z","updated_at":"2012-01-16T14:49:07.000Z","number_of_views":86,"last_viewed":"2023-11-14T19:13:20.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eCode: Bot_478/2010_IMG2369\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHabitat: extensively used grassland, north-east oriented moderate slope, sunny place, however little if any sun during winter months, calcareous ground, exposed to direct rain, average precipitations ~ 3.000 mm/year, average temperature 7-9 deg C, elevation 630 m (2.100 feet), alpine phytogeographical region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubstratum: heavily rotten and moss overgrown stump of a large hardwood tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlace: Vrsnik valley, above the road to Planina Na skali, near Avčin\u0026#8217;s house, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia EC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments: several fruitbodies;
