All were collected in a single square food of bark-mulched ground, probably growing in symbiotic association with Quercus palustra, which reaches heights of approximately 80 feet nearby. The fungus starts out hypogeous (the whitest specimens, sometimes with little or no reddening of the peridium where cut); becoming light violet, quickly turning purplish, and finally becoming powdering brown when mature. In the stages between violet to brown, the peridium quickly stains reddish or pinkish where cut or brushed, as seen in these photos. Will try to keep all of them with the same observation, where they belong. Sclerodermas must be considered poisonous until proven beyond the shadow of a doubt otherwise.

This is actually not me, I didn\u0026#8217;t find this one, this one was found by Dan Molter, and he dried some and sent them to me.  I put them under the scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is observation is really microscopic work on observation 10842, see that one for the initial finding.  This is also the same species and place as obs. 10301 and 10428.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  Here you can clearly see the hymeniform pileipellis, and it is under a thick layer of gelatin.  Which we knew would be there, so that was good to see.  With that surface and the brown spores, it is a Bolbitius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  This is showing the cheilocystidia.  No pleurocystidia was obs.  Also on the gill face the basidia were separated with spacer cells, and were 4-spored.  The spores had no reactions to the Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of the caulocystidia from the stipe apex at 400x in KOH.  The caulocystidia were numerous, and covered the whole length of the stipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth micro-shot is of a spore from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  And here is where it gets interesting.  The spore is light warted (punctate), and that shouldn\u0026#8217;t be for a Bolbitius.  Sorry the warts don\u0026#8217;t quite come out in the photo, they are small, and I didn\u0026#8217;t think they would, you can almost see them in this one.  Also there is no clear germ pore, although the spore wall does appear to thin at the apex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, pretty sure it is Bolbitius, although it shouldn\u0026#8217;t be\u0026#8230;  There is also Descolea a genus in the Bolbiticeae with ornamented spores, but this one is really only found in the southern hemisphere, and Hawaii at least.  Plus the ornamentation of Descolea isn\u0026#8217;t punctate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, poked around in Bolbitius, and tried to see what was known about Bolbitius viscosus.  Turns out this species was published by Watling in 1975, found on Acer log in Michigan, USA.  Searching on that species, I get this Czech paper on a cool bright brick-red Bolbitius with a yellow stipe that would be cool to find.  Anyway, listed in there they have a note about Bolbitius viscosus as a species from the USA with ornamented spores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, this is a weird one, a Bolbitius with ornamented spores from the midwest USA.

Next, the stipe, which is 4-5 inches long, about 1 inch thick, with a layer of slime as well, but also with tiny hairs or minute scales.
