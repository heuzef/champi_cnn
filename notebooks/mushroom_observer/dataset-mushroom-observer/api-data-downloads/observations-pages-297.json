Mushroom shriveled up by day\u0026#8217;s end 9-3, and the disc eventually faded somewhat. No rain throughout the period.

These pictures show immature sporocarps. Sporocysts have not yet opened, capillitium and spore mass are not yet visible. Also stalks are mostly not yet developed. This makes determination even more difficult. Nevertheless, the size and the shape of the oldest sporocarps and stalks with reddish tint points toward Hemitrichia clavata. But, it is possible that the pictures show other Hemitrichia or Trichia species like similar Trichia decipiens or Hemitrichia calyculata. Picture #10 shows eventually another species. On picture #18 one can see also two species of (probably) Ascomycetes \u0026#8211; a larger jelly fungus and smaller black blobs (both lower left). A white \u0026#8216;mycelium\u0026#8217; shown on the same picture (and others \u0026#8211; upper left) probably belongs to another kind of fungus. Although Hemitrichia clavata has white plasmodium these fibers don\u0026#8217;t seem to me to be its plasmodium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRef.:\u003cbr /\u003e\n(1) B.

Species names luridus, uvidus, acris, violascens have been used differently by different authors. I rely on Basso (1999) Ref.3 and IF. She keeps in the section Uvidi (having violet milk) six species. The fungi photographed correspond the closest to the description of Lactarius luridus although the description of its hut doesn\u0026#8217;t fit very well. Hut of Lactarius luridus is according to most sources \u0026#8216;more or less\u0026#8217; zonate, while the mushrooms found were not. Exceptionally, the picture published in Breitenbach (2005) Ref.6. shows two pilei, which are also not zonate. Other options of determination seem less appropriate: L. violascens is distinctly, dark zonate and has narrower spores, L. cistophilus is a Mediterranean species, L. pseudouvidus and L. robertianus are Arctic – Alpine elevations species. Although L. uvidus has azonate pileus like this find, it grows under Betula, Salix, and sometimes under Picea abies, has narrower spores (but not according to Ref.4) and prefers moist habitats. Hence Lactarius luridus seems the best option for this find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo pilei were found about 20 m apart in the same habitat; pilei 6-7 cm in diameter; cutis viscid; stipe dry, 5 cm tall and 1.3 cm in diameter, hollow; gills bruise gray-violet when cut or damaged; milk whitish-pale-yellow, with time and in contact with gills becoming pale violet; trama when cut slowly darkens gray-violet; SP whitish-beige, oac857.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":21168,"consensus_name":"Lactarius luridus","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":921689},{"id":331821,"type":"observation","date":"2018-09-08","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.74239,"created_at":"2018-09-08T21:03:23.000Z","updated_at":"2018-09-08T21:03:29.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2024-02-20T20:26:58.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":28494,"consensus_name":"Lactarius subvernalis var. cokeri","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":921695},{"id":331822,"type":"observation","date":"2018-09-08","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.874483,"created_at":"2018-09-08T21:07:04.000Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T14:56:28.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2024-02-08T13:01:42.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":509,"consensus_name":"Lactarius torminosus","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":921699},{"id":331823,"type":"observation","date":"2018-09-08","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.7424,"created_at":"2018-09-08T21:08:42.000Z","updated_at":"2018-09-08T21:08:46.000Z","number_of_views":13,"last_viewed":"2024-02-28T12:18:29.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":815,"consensus_name":"Lactarius","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":921703},{"id":331824,"type":"observation","date":"2018-09-08","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.871258,"created_at":"2018-09-08T21:10:04.000Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T00:50:55.000Z","number_of_views":26,"last_viewed":"2024-02-26T21:43:27.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":2726,"consensus_name":"Lactarius camphoratus","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":921705},{"id":331825,"type":"observation","date":"2018-09-08","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.7424,"created_at":"2018-09-08T21:11:27.000Z","updated_at":"2018-09-08T21:11:33.000Z","number_of_views":15,"last_viewed":"2024-01-10T20:06:25.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":815,"consensus_name":"Lactarius","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":921708},{"id":331826,"type":"observation","date":"2018-09-08","latitude":"38.8198","longitude":"-77.2577","altitude":80,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.52247,"created_at":"2018-09-08T21:16:58.000Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T23:21:45.000Z","number_of_views":25,"last_viewed":"2024-01-29T15:07:39.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eThe specimen does not closely match anything in my Field Guide.
