The problem was, as I wrongly thought, they grew exclusively on tree bark, not on wood directly (most frequently they do so, but not exclusively). Therefore I considered genus Kretzschmaria, possibly not yet mature and common Kretzschmaria deusta. I know bright whitish-gray anamorph of it and quite common mature completely black stroma. But I\u0026#8217;ve never found something in between. Only after consulting AscoFrance, Mr. Enrique Rubio the pictures were determined as Annulohypoxylon cohaerens (former Hypoxylon cohaerens). Genus Annulohypoxylon was separated from genus Hypoxylon in 2005. Actually subglobose, somewhat flattened above, confluent, at first brown, stroma with papillate ostioles fit well to this determination although the fungus is not yet fully mature. This fungus is an inhabitant of beech and it appears on bare wood as well as on bark. It often grows together with similar Hypoxylon fragiforme, which is a very common species in our woods.  Extraction of pigments by KOH and microscopy would make this determination crystal-clear. But this was not done.

Morphological traits as well as substratum seem to be right. Also the picture published in Wirt (1995) (Ref.1), which is also cited as relevant in Smith et al. (2009) (Ref.2) shows great similarity with this find. The same seems to be true for the pictures published in Ref.5. The only objection may be, that in this find there are only a few flattened isidia seen. Apparently most of them are still young and hence +/- globose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollema crispum doesn\u0026#8217;t seem to be a valid name any more. Recent molecular studies have changed taxonomy of jelly fungi (Collemataceae) drastically. The main morphological distinguishing trait between the largest and commonest genera Collema and Leptogium, that is thallus cortex character, is clearly proven not to be monophyletic. Phylogenetic molecular study (Otálora et al. 2013) (Ref.6) has been done (based on the best unconstrained trees), which resulted in some clades, for which there was no morphology supporting such a classification. In 2014 in order to reconcile morphology and molecular data, a new classification for Collemataceae was proposed (Ref.3). Based on slightly constrained topology ten clades were proposed. All of them can be characterized using a combination of traits as habitat preference, thallus habit, ascospore characteristics, thallus anatomical structure, and cortex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, following Index Fungorum the name Collema crispum (Hudson) Weber ex Wigg. is a synonym. Corresponding current name is Blennothallia crispa (Huds.) Otálora, P.M. Jørg. \u0026amp; Wedin,  Fungal Diversity 64: 282 (2014). According to the key published in Otálora et al. (2014) (Ref.3) genus Blennothallia should have thallus with partially paraplectenchymatous medulla (a fungal tissue consisting of more or less isodiametric, rounded to angular cells) and Nostoc photobiont in short chains with less than 3 cells.  Both traits clearly do not correspond to my find. According to the key the observed non-paraplectenchymatous medulla and very long Nostoc chains speak in favor of (new) Collema or (new) Lathagrium genus. But Collema is now mainly a corticolous genus and my find is strictly saxicolous. Also in the list of species C. crispum doesn\u0026#8217;t exist. Similarly in the (new) genus Lathagrium the name L. crispum does not exist. Also, for (new) genus Lathagrium very frequent apothecia are characteristic. But I haven\u0026#8217;t found a single one on more than ten specimens  carefully checked. Thus I don\u0026#8217;t know how to properly name this find (even not to genus level). I will stay with old Collema crispum although it is possible that this find is not that or that I missed something in this complex naming issue? Any help or idea is very much welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThallus loosely attached to the rock by scattered whitish hapters; photographed in wet state after rainy days; isidiate; blackish-brown and fragile when dry.

Quite thick-stiped and stocky, with a club-shaped bulbous base. Cap was several cm across; not very big. Did not seem to bruise, but perhaps the mushroom was too old or the change was too slow. I felt that it had a \u0026#8220;mealy\u0026#8221; smell, but perhaps that would be considered \u0026#8220;bread\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;almond\u0026#8221; by some. I highly doubt this Agaricus is one of the phenol ones, though, and it would not be one of the cypress ones, either. The sole conifer around the location would be Gray (Foothill) Pine, which is unlikely to host an Agaricus. I have received a number of photos from Pinnacles of A. incultorum, so that species definitely grows here, but I do not think this fits that very well (thickened stipe base, for example).

As a beginner in the subject, I\u0026#8217;m deeply grateful to my co-author in that paper \u0026#8211; André Aptroot \u0026#8211; a true expert in the genus \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Graphis\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eGraphis\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and of several other genera in lichens.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe material from the microscopy accompanying each observation is from my initial observations of the specimens and not from the subsequent analysis made by André to which every specimen was subjected. I will start posting at least one observation for each species reported as new to Europe in that paper and maybe in the future I will have opportunity to post some other observation made by that time and not further developed and thus not considered in the paper.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis paper was motivated by my refuse to accept that what I was observing in the field should be named as one of the very few species known to Europe at the time, a number that does not exceeded that of the fingers of a hand. It is my conviction that, even with the inclusion of the number of species in the afore mentioned article, that number is still far from translating the reality of the diversity of representation of that genus in my country. \u003cbr /\u003e\nThe main reference for the study of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Graphis\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eGraphis\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is Ref. 1 \u0026#8211; \u0026#8220;A world-wide key to the genus Graphis\u0026#8221; by Lucking, Archer \u0026amp; Aptroot; it was published together with Ref. 2 \u0026#8211; \u0026#8220;The taxonomy of the genus Graphis sensu Staiger\u0026#8221; by Lucking, where the concepts used in the key are introduced and developed; two of the authors of Ref. 1 also participated in Ref. 3 \u0026#8211; \u0026#8220;A first assessment of the Ticolichen Biodiversity Inventory in Costa Rica\u0026#8221;, where many species are described and some groups of species with similar features are mentioned.\u003cbr /\u003e\nEach observation will contain the following set of characters:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eSPECIES\u003c/b\u003e: (details to reach the name are given below)\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eDATE\u003c/b\u003e: yyyy/mm/dd\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eSPECIMEN Nº\u003c/b\u003e:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003ePLACE\u003c/b\u003e: \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eHABITAT\u003c/b\u003e:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eSUBSTRATE\u003c/b\u003e:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eMICRO FEATURES\u003c/b\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eStriation\u003c/b\u003e: (levels: Entire / Striate)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eCarbonization\u003c/b\u003e: (levels: Apical / Lateral / Complete)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eInspersion\u003c/b\u003e: (levels: Clear / Inspersed)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eAscospores\u003c/b\u003e: (levels: Transverse / Muriform) \u0026#8211; Size (levels: small / medium / large)\n\t\u003cul\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eGROUP No.\u003c/b\u003e: (as defined in Ref. 1 of this observation)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCHEMISTRY\u003c/b\u003e:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eASCOSPORES DIMENSIONS\u003c/b\u003e:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eEVOLUTION IN THE KEY\u003c/b\u003e: (according Ref. 1 of this observation)\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eINTERNAL LINKS\u003c/b\u003e: (MO observations, if existing)\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eEXTERNAL LINKS\u003c/b\u003e: (with illustrations of the species)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis first observation is devoted to one of the species that is widespread in one of the two regions referred in Ref. 4 \u0026#8211; Serra de Sintra \u0026#8211; one of our richest locations for lichens as can be seen from my past observations from there.
