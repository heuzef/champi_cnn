Maybe there\u0026#8217;s something to be learned here. Back then I vacillated between subvelutipes and subluridellus. In 2011 I chose subvelutipes. Now I think differently and choose subluridellus. Here\u0026#8217;s my reasoning: In 2011 I mistakenly thought there was a contradiction in the macro-chemical tests for the two but there isn\u0026#8217;t, at least not with the tests I do with KOH and NH4OH. I didn\u0026#8217;t do microscopy. That leaves macro descriptions. rereading the descriptions in all my sources I found- subvelutipes has a stipe that\u0026#8217;s red and yellow. These have yellow stipes. if you think you see red on the stipe I\u0026#8217;m going to suggest that\u0026#8217;s a bruise. there are no \u0026#8220;stiff red hairs\u0026#8221; at the base.
