Along the border there are several 20-25 foot tall oaks. These oaks were quite small when I first moved into the house here over 20 years ago. There\u0026#8217;s also a very large shagbark hickory (Carya ovata) and mature white pines about 15-20 feet from the patch where the Tylopilus grows. Of the 20 summers that I have lived here 15 or more of those years featured one or more fruiting of large Tylopilus fruit bodies in this 3-4 square yard area. All tested for taste have been bitter. Cap color ranges from the brown as seen in 460899 to purple brown to dark purple. Stipe color is sometimes more pale than the one seen. In a few cases a thin but complete reticulatum covers the upper 10% of the stipe. In a few cases KOH applied to the cap surface caused a greenish-yellow reaction. Despite variability in cap color, I believe these have all represented the same taxon. I believe the Carya ovata is the primary associate (because other similar fruit bodies collected from other areas on my property have all been found close to Carya ovata trees). For years I have called all of these Tylopilis rubrobrunneus, which seemed to be the best morphological fit (despite the KOH reaction not matching what has been reported for T. rubrobrunneus). Interpreting ITS generated by the fruit body seen here suggests it does not represent T. rubrobrunneus.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSpore dimensions estimated as 9.5-12 \u0026#215; 3-3.5.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":897,"consensus_name":"Tylopilus","location_id":24198,"location_name":"Property at 239 Golf Course Rd., Hunlock Twp., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":1354569},{"id":460900,"type":"observation","date":"2021-07-20","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.66546,"created_at":"2021-07-20T16:28:06.000Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T16:58:10.000Z","number_of_views":19,"last_viewed":"2022-01-02T14:35:35.000Z","owner_id":66256,"consensus_id":19907,"consensus_name":"Gliophorus perplexus","location_id":23973,"location_name":"Califon, New Jersey, USA","primary_image_id":1354578},{"id":460901,"type":"observation","date":"2021-07-17","latitude":"41.2514","longitude":"-76.0531","altitude":365,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.73967,"created_at":"2021-07-20T16:46:44.000Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T20:23:34.000Z","number_of_views":109,"last_viewed":"2023-07-23T15:12:37.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eSolitary fruit body in mixed hardwoods. \u003cbr /\u003e\nFor a number of years I had called the relatively small vividly yellow type \u0026#8220;velatipes\u0026#8221;.

The forest is almost all oak, hickory, and birch. Trees are mature but not particularly old. A few of the oaks feature trunks about 18 inches wide. The closest hemlock is over 100 yards from where this amanita was found. A bit closer, but outside of the interior of this hardwood forest, there is a lone mature white pine where the forest transitions to an open area near the park road. Emanating from this large white pine is a row of 10-12 white pine saplings, spaced about 15-20 feet apart with the one furthest from the large pine situated not far from where the amanita was found. These saplings are 2.5-4 feet tall and are likely obscured by the fairly thick understory during the summer.

White leading edge very thin, yellow band thinning, slight spore drop visible(adhering electrostatically to cap). Sliced a small portion from this fruit and dried for home herbarium collection. Many of my fruiting locations have been unfortunately harvested by other folks. Pores measure 2-3 per mm. A quick note on pore size. Ganoderma oregonense pores are very dense, small when very young(pre-spore drop) and before planing will often measure 4-6 per mm before planing/maturing. It is likely that most all early collections of what was considered to be G. tsugae in the past we’re simply immature fruits of G. oregonense(as this collection had 5-6 pores per mm two weeks ago when measured). Always wait for spore drop and universal/nearly completely Maroon lacquered cap surface before harvesting and taking spore measurements underneath with this species. Genetic analysis and DNA sequencing have all turned up G. oregonense for Westcoast collections of Western Hemlock infecting specimens of varnished Ganoderma. None have been positively confirmed as G. tsugae. The early harvesting and miscalculation by early keys has contributed to this confusion. I will continue to monitor this fruiting until full maturity(fingers crossed that no one harvests it before).\u003cbr /\u003e\nUpdate 8/13/21: Fully mature and completely covered in spores(electrostatically dispersed and adhering to cap).
