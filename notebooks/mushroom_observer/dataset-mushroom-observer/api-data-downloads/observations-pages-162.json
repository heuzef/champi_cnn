Moreover, despite the similarity referred for the two species, the apothecia of the first is usually (white) pruinose specially at the margin of apothecia, where the pruina is cinnabar-red, while the second is usually not pruinose or with pruina along the edges. This specimen is pruinose, having both white pruina and red pruina (mainly at margin) on apothecia.  The spores of the two species are similar in shape but very different in dimensions and septation:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Arbutus+cinnabarina\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA. cinnabarina\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e: (18) 20-28 \u0026#215; 7-9.5 um; (2) 4 to 5 (6) septa;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Arbutus+elegans\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA. elegans\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e: (12) 14 \u0026#8211; 19 \u0026#215; 4.5-7 um; (2) 3 or 4 (5) septa.\u003cbr /\u003e\nFor my specimen I obtained:\u003cbr /\u003e\n(13.4) 13.8 \u0026#8211; 15.9 (16.3) x (4.8) 4.9 \u0026#8211; 5.7 (6) µm; Q = (2.3) 2.5 \u0026#8211; 3 (3.1) ; N = 25; Me = 14.9 \u0026#215; 5.3 µm ; Qe = 2.8; Most spores with 3 septa.\u003cbr /\u003e\nTherefore, I believe this can be classified as \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Arbutus+elegans\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA. elegans\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, despite of having pruinose apothecia.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2250,"consensus_id":30935,"consensus_name":"Arthonia elegans","location_id":1063,"location_name":"Planalto das Cezaredas, Portugal","primary_image_id":481495},{"id":188278,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-13","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.81941,"created_at":"2014-11-14T00:07:09.000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T02:47:13.000Z","number_of_views":34,"last_viewed":"2022-01-18T09:27:40.000Z","owner_id":4122,"consensus_id":5856,"consensus_name":"Lepiota lilacea","location_id":2953,"location_name":"Turlock, Stanislaus Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":481503},{"id":188279,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-02","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.58128,"created_at":"2014-11-14T00:08:00.000Z","updated_at":"2014-11-14T00:09:32.000Z","number_of_views":20,"last_viewed":"2024-02-15T09:34:29.000Z","owner_id":2250,"consensus_id":6485,"consensus_name":"Bacidia","location_id":1063,"location_name":"Planalto das Cezaredas, Portugal","primary_image_id":481505},{"id":188280,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-11","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.38199,"created_at":"2014-11-14T00:12:05.000Z","updated_at":"2014-11-14T00:12:14.000Z","number_of_views":11,"last_viewed":"2024-02-24T16:17:22.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eTons of this growing in coastal Sitka spruce \u0026amp; redwood forest.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6618,"consensus_id":953,"consensus_name":"Lactarius fallax","location_id":651,"location_name":"Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, Humboldt Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":481514},{"id":188281,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-11","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.794329,"created_at":"2014-11-14T00:11:59.000Z","updated_at":"2014-11-14T00:12:27.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2024-02-28T02:14:51.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing under Stika spruce in coastal forest\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6618,"consensus_id":653,"consensus_name":"Boletus smithii","location_id":651,"location_name":"Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, Humboldt Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":481512},{"id":188282,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-11","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.39404,"created_at":"2014-11-14T00:14:45.000Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T19:55:28.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2023-08-29T20:36:17.000Z","owner_id":6618,"consensus_id":648,"consensus_name":"Albatrellus flettii","location_id":8543,"location_name":"Big Lagoon, Humboldt Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":481517},{"id":188283,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-13","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.68581,"created_at":"2014-11-14T00:22:30.000Z","updated_at":"2014-11-14T00:22:47.000Z","number_of_views":14,"last_viewed":"2023-08-18T23:35:56.000Z","owner_id":4122,"consensus_id":43579,"consensus_name":"Pholiota sect.
