Any advice is appreciated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA. Basal bulb appears as rubescens (I took multiple pics of the basal bulb, rotating it for all side views:\u003cbr /\u003e\nThere is no cleft/split present. However, there are two other theories:\u003cbr /\u003e\n1. I have an unusual specimen either without a cleft or having only a subtle one\u003cbr /\u003e\nI didn\u0026#8217;t consider a cleft.\u003cbr /\u003e\n2. It somehow doesn\u0026#8217;t show the cleft w/my photos or there is one that I\u0026#8217;m not\u003cbr /\u003e\nnoticing. Possibly the angles are deceiving. I\u0026#8217;ll go get the actual specimen.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026#8230;okay, I see it is not what I would call cleft. I\u0026#8217;ve attached additional pics\u003cbr /\u003e\nof the basal bulb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB. Stipe discoloration appears to me much more a rubescens:\u003cbr /\u003e\nI see pink in it, but upon your comment I do detect some brown in both the photo\u003cbr /\u003e\nand actual specimen. Still, I\u0026#8217;ll have to go with rubescens over brunescens,\u003cbr /\u003e\nparticularly when looking at Michael Kuo\u0026#8217;s pictures of brunescens that show what\u003cbr /\u003e\nI consider a straight brown with a slight reddish quality. From what I\u0026#8217;ve read,\u003cbr /\u003e\nbrunescens lacks pink in its discoloration.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAlternate theories:\u003cbr /\u003e\n1. Though containing pink should completely rule out brunescens, one could argue\u003cbr /\u003e\nrubescens shouldn\u0026#8217;t contain any brown. However, to the best of my knowledge\u003cbr /\u003e\nthis argument isn\u0026#8217;t accurate to the differential identification of these\u003cbr /\u003e\nmushrooms. Please correct me if I\u0026#8217;m wrong (e.g., if a rubescens can\u0026#8217;t contain\u003cbr /\u003e\nany brown).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC. Pileus flesh discoloration:\u003cbr /\u003e\nAlthough there was no discoloration where parts of the pileus broke off as it\u003cbr /\u003e\nmushroomed out of the ground, where I cut a piece off yesterday is now showing\u003cbr /\u003e\ndiscoloration. The flesh is discolored a light pink (see attached photos).\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis brings me back to rubescens. Confusingly, and maybe an amanita expert can\u003cbr /\u003e\ncomment, the gills discolored yellow on the far right (see attached photos).\u003cbr /\u003e\nAlt. theory:\u003cbr /\u003e\n1. One could argue there\u0026#8217;s a brown or darker color w/in the pink discoloration.\u003cbr /\u003e\nI personally could say maybe a salmon color. Anyway, \u0026#8220;B.\u0026#8221; above should apply to\u003cbr /\u003e\nthis situation, I\u0026#8217;d believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso of note, the indoor lighting pictures are of a definite\u003cbr /\u003e\n(a # of experts concurred) blusher found last year by the same tree, but on\u003cbr /\u003e\n10/13/11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks everyone.
