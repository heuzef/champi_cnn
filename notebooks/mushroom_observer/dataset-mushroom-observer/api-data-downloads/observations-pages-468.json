They fruited shortly after the big rains from the remnants of hurricane Ian and were slightly waterlogged.  The soil was still very wet.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe overall morphology can be inferred from the photos.  The cap color is very accurate as the photos were taken under light-neutral conditions (scattered natural light).\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe largest cap (single fb) measured 5.7 cm in diameter.  The lovely color of the cap disc was closest to 7A5 (pastel red) in the \u003ccite\u003eMethuen Handbook of Colour\u003c/cite\u003e by Kornerup \u0026amp; Wanschler and oac693 in the  \u003ccite\u003eOnline Auction Color Chart\u003c/cite\u003e (turned much darker red upon drying).  However, one can see a much darker red pigmentation spot/area where the two caps are conjoined (see photos).  It\u0026#8217;s not clear if this is an aberration or whether the dominant paler color of the pileipellis is the result of natural fading due to the weather and/or environmental conditions (the location is exposed to the afternoon sun from the south).  The cuticle peeled slightly less than 1/2 R (two trials).\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe gill plates en masse had a pale creamy hue to my eyes, so I expected the color of the spore print to be the same (non-white); however, the spore print taken on aluminum foil was stark white.  Very few short gills and gill forks were present.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe flesh didn\u0026#8217;t stain when injured on the upper stipe, and the observed deepening of the color in the wound can probably be attributed to a change in the refractive properties of the injured tissue more than anything else. However, one can clearly see \u0026#8220;discoloration\u0026#8221; at the base of the stipe where effort was made to remove excessive soil/dirt, but even this can perhaps be explained by the reaction of the waterlogged flesh to manipulation.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe taste, though non-bitter and non-acrid, was chalky and greasy and thus unpleasant.  The odor was either nondescript or mild/fungal.\u003cbr /\u003e\nFatto/Kibby codes applicable to the morphological properties of this species are either AIKNPT (if cap color is considered some shade of red or salmon) and CIKNPT (if cap color is interpreted as some shade of ochraceous/orange).  The first code corresponds to species \u003ccite\u003epraeumbonata\u003c/cite\u003e and \u003ccite\u003erosea\u003c/cite\u003e, but neither is a fit.  The second code lists \u003ccite\u003eheterophylla\u003c/cite\u003e (doesn\u0026#8217;t fit) and \u003ccite\u003estricta\u003c/cite\u003e.  The second species authored by Murrill is rather obscure when in comes to searching it online; there appear to be no pictures of vouchers identified as \u003ccite\u003eR. stricta\u003c/cite\u003e.  Murrill\u0026#8217;s description of the cap is \u0026#8220;isabelline with testaceous and ochraceous hues\u0026#8221;, while Fatto/Kibby\u0026#8217;s description is \u0026#8220;tan with brick or ochraceous hues (dark grayish-yellow 91 with reddish brown or ochre)\u0026#8221;.  Fatto/Kibby list a few southern russulas under these codes, all authored by Murrill.
