When dry it is not really an attractive species. Genus Physcia includes many species, which are not always easy to determine to species level. However, Physcia adscendens is easy to recognize. Its white maculated (spotted) lobes have on their margins characteristic long, darker tipped cilia. The fertile lobes are helmet- or hood-shaped at their ends. Inner side of them (that is between upper and lower cortex of the thallus) is covered by brighter, yellowish colored soredia. Apothecia are rare, up to 2 mm in diameter and almost stalked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pictures were taken after several days of heavy rains.

It is monotonously whitish-gray or gray and blends well with grayish bark of tree branches and twigs. However, when wet its bluish or greenish colors pop out distinctly. Its dark and almost always abundant apothecia pup out from much lighter thallus and its distinctive maculae (white spots on greenish thallus) become very apparent. Physcia aipolia is quite a common lichen and has been recorded in Slovenian Alps many times (Ref.: 6, 7, 8). It can be distinguished from several other similar Physcia species by distinctive maculae, yellow K reaction of thallus and medulla and pale lower side of the thallus having pale rhizines. It is mostly growing on small and medium size branches of smooth barked trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":6361,"consensus_name":"Physcia aipolia","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":842906},{"id":308084,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-29","latitude":"7.5204","longitude":"-66.3849","altitude":55,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.6353,"created_at":"2018-02-01T13:40:19.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-16T20:32:56.000Z","number_of_views":520,"last_viewed":"2024-03-27T04:55:55.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eI believe this is a very small specimen of what I\u0026#8217;ve collected before in San Juan associated with Coccoloba uvifera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8212;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMirrored on iNaturalist as \u003ca href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/150139847\"\u003eobservation 150139847\u003c/a\u003e on March 3, 2023.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":8211,"consensus_id":110056,"consensus_name":"Amanita \"sp-PR01\"","location_id":17249,"location_name":"Piñones, Loiza, Puerto Rico, USA","primary_image_id":842909},{"id":308085,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-16","latitude":"35.8565","longitude":"-120.3048","altitude":497,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.54132,"created_at":"2018-02-01T14:28:09.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T14:28:14.000Z","number_of_views":26,"last_viewed":"2023-10-29T17:45:24.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn sandstone bedrock, beneath blue oak (Quercus douglasii).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Caloplaca+impolita\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eCaloplaca impolita\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Caloplaca+ignea\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eCaloplaca ignea\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and others.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2792,"consensus_id":9164,"consensus_name":"Diplotomma alboatrum","location_id":61,"location_name":"Monterey Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":842913},{"id":308087,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-16","latitude":"35.8565","longitude":"-120.3048","altitude":497,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69423,"created_at":"2018-02-01T14:34:05.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T14:34:08.000Z","number_of_views":47,"last_viewed":"2023-12-31T16:11:17.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn sandstone bedrock, beneath blue oak (Quercus douglasii).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Caloplaca+ignea\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eCaloplaca ignea\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Diplotomma+alboatrum\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eDiplotomma alboatrum\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2792,"consensus_id":8059,"consensus_name":"Caloplaca impolita","location_id":61,"location_name":"Monterey Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":842924},{"id":308088,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-29","latitude":"34.347","longitude":"-85.0769","altitude":206,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.80865,"created_at":"2018-02-01T14:42:13.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T15:04:18.000Z","number_of_views":39,"last_viewed":"2024-04-18T19:23:44.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing on a fallen (dead) hardwood in a heavily wooded (shaded) area at the edge of a park complex in Northwest Georgia (Floyd County), US.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":10736,"consensus_id":30099,"consensus_name":"Trametes betulina","location_id":16078,"location_name":"Shannon, Georgia, USA","primary_image_id":842929},{"id":308089,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.847347,"created_at":"2018-02-01T15:24:11.000Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T14:45:21.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2023-11-05T03:46:04.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eNon-lichenized peretheciate-like fungi on fibers of dead wood from Quercus agrifolia.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2792,"consensus_id":108879,"consensus_name":"Corticiales","location_id":1451,"location_name":"Santa Barbara Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":842934},{"id":308090,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-27","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.68306,"created_at":"2018-02-01T15:26:49.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T15:26:52.000Z","number_of_views":26,"last_viewed":"2023-10-31T04:41:23.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eTwo small orange mushrooms growing on rotting wood in a swampy, mixed forest.

It is known from Europe and East America. A characteristic trait of this species is roundish soralia produced on somewhat uplifted tips of the terminal thallus lobes. Soredia are distinctly lighter in color than thallus, greenish and farinous-granular. Apothecia are said to be rare (Ref.:1) or occasional (Ref.:2), however on this tree they were frequent. Dark lower side of the thallus is covered with zillions of conspicuous simple black rhizines. Also the apothecia have an interesting corona of black rhizines growing from their outer lower surface (Pic. 3). The species is dark gray or almost black when dry. On this tree, laying on ground, about 25 different lichens have been observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":12539,"consensus_name":"Phaeophyscia pusilloides","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":843323},{"id":308206,"type":"observation","date":"2018-02-03","latitude":"33.5313","longitude":"-88.6506","altitude":73,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.53502,"created_at":"2018-02-03T23:45:36.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T04:21:02.000Z","number_of_views":72,"last_viewed":"2024-02-21T05:51:29.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn living eastern cedar (Juniperus virginiana).\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":10569,"consensus_id":62527,"consensus_name":"Pyrofomes juniperinus","location_id":17226,"location_name":"Golden triangle Horse Rescue, West Point, Mississippi, USA","primary_image_id":843338},{"id":308207,"type":"observation","date":"2013-10-25","latitude":"49.8084","longitude":"-119.3749","altitude":931,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.03659,"created_at":"2018-02-04T00:48:07.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T00:48:09.000Z","number_of_views":27,"last_viewed":"2024-01-17T01:14:03.000Z","owner_id":11936,"consensus_id":61510,"consensus_name":"Xylaria hypoxylon","location_id":12556,"location_name":"Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada","primary_image_id":843346},{"id":308208,"type":"observation","date":"2018-02-03","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70272,"created_at":"2018-02-04T00:52:17.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T01:21:57.000Z","number_of_views":37,"last_viewed":"2024-02-27T22:24:43.000Z","owner_id":2304,"consensus_id":21238,"consensus_name":"Byssomerulius corium","location_id":8414,"location_name":"Wildcat Gorge Trail, Tilden Regional Park, Contra Costa Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":843347},{"id":308209,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-28","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.74309,"created_at":"2018-02-04T01:45:08.000Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T02:59:57.000Z","number_of_views":137,"last_viewed":"2023-12-30T06:27:54.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eI forgot to get a photo of these, but it\u0026#8217;s the Leotia lubrica collection from Albion II.

It climbs up to the tree border elevations. It can be found on bark of deciduous trees as well as on conifers and sometimes also on rocks. Pictures show a young, still small specimen in damp state. Hence the thallus is almost white. Grown up specimens are darker \u0026#8211; gray or brownish-gray, often densely covered with isidia and dark brown to black underneath. When old they sometimes become of bizarre shapes appearing completely different from these pictures. Apothecia are rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe species is very variable. Probably the best trait for determination is its growth. Terminal thallus strap-shaped lobes divide widely divergent and quite strictly dichotomously. All terminal lobes remain in a single plane and they are rather short. When dry the edges of the straps curl strongly inwards, sometimes completely covering the lower, black side of the straps. A very similarly looking habit has another common lichen \u0026#8211; Evernia prunastri (L.) Ach..
