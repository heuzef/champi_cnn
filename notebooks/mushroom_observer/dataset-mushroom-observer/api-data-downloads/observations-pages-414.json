It has multi-spore asci, which contain more than 100 spores each.  The species is almost impossible to be distinguished from very similar Clauzadea monticola in the field. But the latter has 8-spored asci, which separates both species immediately. Calcareous rock in Trenta (limestone or dolomite) has on some rare places inclusions of much harder rock than surrounding. The intrusions look crystalline and in parts almost as quartz and are colored yellowish-ochre or reddish. But, HCL test proved they were also calcareous. Lecidea type apothecia were strictly limited to these inclusions. The apothecia are black and flat or slightly concave when dry and dark reddish-brown, like somewhat translucent, and distinctly convex.

I split the contents between three different areas, each with an old (healthy) apple tree. Last year was the first time a morel has ever appeared in any of these spots \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/407533\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 407533\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e same location as this present observation, about 4 feet away. Over the years I have tossed morel trimmings and dumped water used to clean trays form my dehydrator into this area. The fruit body seen here (as well as 407533) does not look like any of our native PA species. 15 years seems like a long time for sclerotia to persist. I wonder if the planted Morchella has become naturalized? Possibly forming an association with the apple tree?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to wait longer than 5 days to harvest this. But a windy/chilly night seemed like a threat. So I plucked it. Just barely mature enough to drop a few spores. I also found some spores via a smash mount of hymenium. All spores observed were in the range 17-23 \u0026#215; 11-14. This is too small for M. angusticeps and way too small for M. snyderi. Range is a good match for M. importuna. Some aspects of this fruit body seem to not be a particularly good match for M. importuna; the relatively stout stature and lack of \u0026#8220;ladder-like\u0026#8221; cross-ridges. Perhaps this is due to prevailing atmospheric conditions (range in temperature/humidity) different from what is typical where M. importuna is usually found. If M. importuna is the correct ID then it is interesting to me that a presumably saprobic fungus would survive in an alien environment apparently devoid of its favored nutrient source (spread wood chips) while not producing fruit bodies (until after 15 years). It is my understanding that some morel grow kits are seeded with sclerotia. Could a sclerotium remain in-situ for 15 years? Or has this fungus formed an association with something where it was planted (presumably with the large healthy apple tree)? \u003cbr /\u003e\nWhen this ITS sequence first became available there were BLAST matches with each of M. laurentiana and M. eohespera. The edited version of the sequence is now seen to match multiple representatives of M. eohespera, and M. laurentiana does not appear. Other matches include names representing taxa from section Distantes (angusticeps, importuna, etc\u0026#8230;).
