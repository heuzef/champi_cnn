According to the references I checked ( by G.Lincoff, D.Arora, G.Barron, R.Phillips, M.Kuo) the sharp central knob, inrolled margin in youth, decurrent forked blunt gills, tough stem which is longer than cap seem to point to Cantharellula umbonata. In the references cited FB colors vary:  color of cap described from grayish-brown to smoky-grey to brown, gray or beige. Gills described as white to cream bruising yellow or red. Stem as white to grayish. As it seems clear that the FB\u0026#8217;s in this obs were being parasitized (see photos 4 and 6 especially), I checked the USDA Hypomyces website to which M. Kuo refers and found that Hypomyces spp. parasitize many of the Agaricales order and some change the form, color and/or texture of the host (as in H. lactifluorum for example) such that as M. Kuo says:  \u0026#8220;Often the parasite fungus so transforms the host mushroom that it\u0026#8217;s impossible to tell what the host was.\u0026#8221; The USDA site has an interactive key which suggests that H. hyalinus may be the culprit here:  \u0026#8220;Covering host\u0026#8217;s hymenophore, host\u0026#8217;s pileus and stipe; host\u0026#8217;s basidiomata turn firm\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212;this last statement perhaps accounting for the chalk-like stem.  According to the website H. hyalinus is common in the NE USA and eastern Canada.

The plant has an almost legendary status as a rarity. Many people, including professionals, have been searching for it for decades in vain. In 2009 in the UK, the rare ghost orchid was declared extinct since it had been not recorded since 1987. However, in 2010, according to Guardian, 8 March 2010 a single 5 cm high plant was found again by a botanist who revealed it is still alive in the UK. In Slovenia we \u0026#8216;theoretically\u0026#8217; have about 15 historically known localities, however, many of them not confirmed for decades. The above ground parts of the plant appear unpredictably and once only in every few years. At this location I\u0026#8217;v saw it only in 2008 and 2011. Enlisted in the Slovene Red List of rare and endangered species, marked by \u0026#8220;V\u0026#8221; representing a vulnerable species. It is considered critically endangered worldwide according to IUCN 2.3.
