All were almost unable to stand freely and when I attempted to remove them from their habitat the Volvas were easily separated from the stipes. There was not the usual large rounded shape, but more of a thick loose volva wrapping at the stipe base.  There was also a shredding effect at the point of separation of the volvas from the stipes. The stipes were white in colour and almost transparent but not reaching that stage. The ground was wet and the forest floor plant life looked healthy.  The condition of the fungi could have been due to the wet period we have had and also the low level of daylight available to the fungi. I still collected the three fungi very carefully , but by the time I had arrived home they were disintegrating and loosing moisture. I was unable to save them as dried specimens.
