characters: Aspergillus melleus colonies typically sporulate well and produce abundant white to yellow to brownish orange sclerotia. On DG18, colonies have a greyish green (1C4) colour in mycelial areas and an olive reverse. A similar olive reverse was observed in A. pallidofulvus, A. ochraceus, A. ostianus and A. roseoglobulosus. However, A. melleus lacks the dull red mycelia of A. roseoglobulosus on CYA, grows faster on CYA at 37 °C than A. ostianus (no growth to microcolonies), and grows faster than A. ochraceus (40–47 mm, 25–35 mm) on CYA at 30 and 33 °C. Compared to A. pallidofulvus, A. melleus has a more orange conidial colour on MEA, grows slower on MEA, DG18 and OA, and produces finely roughened conidia, which are smooth in A. pallidofulvus.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom- Stud Mycol. 2014 Jun; 78: 1–61.
