This interaction and co-mingling mycorrhizal relationship of two separate species together has been evident with this group of trees for not only the amanita and porcini here, but also for co-fruitings of Suillus and Gomphidious, in addition to the earlier Chalciporus piperatus and Amanita muscaria subs. flavivolvata observed earlier here in the season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElevation: Sea level.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2822,"consensus_id":5066,"consensus_name":"Amanita muscaria subsp. flavivolvata","location_id":16292,"location_name":"North Street SE, Olympia, Thurston Co., Washington, USA","primary_image_id":812282},{"id":298605,"type":"observation","date":"2017-10-22","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.67522,"created_at":"2017-11-14T13:07:43.000Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T20:45:56.000Z","number_of_views":95,"last_viewed":"2024-02-17T06:58:50.000Z","notes_fields":{"Collection_#":"\u003cp\u003eOMS 300601\u003c/p\u003e","Collector":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_user/Christian+Schwarz\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eChristian Schwarz\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","Identifier":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_user/Christian+Schwarz\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eChristian Schwarz\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},"notes":"\u003cp\u003eThis Observation is a placeholder.
