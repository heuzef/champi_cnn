There are two points of heterogeneity in ITS1 separated by a considerable number of bases (ca. 45 bps), as deduced from the two reads.  The heterogeneity pattern in the forward read cannot be resolved.  The heterogeneity pattern in the reverse read appears to be a 2-base frameshift, but resolving this pattern manually to separate the 2 haplotypes is very difficult and was not attempted due to a high probability of error making.  Hence, the stretch of ITS1 obscured by the heteromorphy cannot be resolved and the reads cannot be bridged together.  Unfortunately, the legible portion of the forward read is only 132 characters long, which is too short for publication in GenBank.  On the other hand, the reverse read, consisting of the last 10 bps of ITS1 followed by complete 5.8S and ITS2 regions and the first 21 bases of LSU, is overall 351 bps long and will be submitted to GenBank.

observation is important as this specimens were observed at 230m altitude, in mixed hornbeam/oak forest. Finding them at this low altitute is something it\u0026#8217;s unheard of. And it was unusually wavy capped. Serbica is mostly associated with old growth beech and pine forest, it almost never occurs outside of that habitat and at altitudes less than 500m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing however I remain uncertain. I might accidentally spreaded spores here since this find is not far from my house and I visit this forest often. Also last year I carried water bottle with serbica spores and splashed them wherever I thought it\u0026#8217;s cool.

Alignment of the present ITS sequence with those of \u003ccite\u003esubsejunctum\u003c/cite\u003e sensu MycoQuebec shows that all the mismatching positions (11) are due to gaps and all but one are associated with an \u003ccite\u003eindel\u003c/cite\u003e event in ITS1 (the Canadian sequences are longer).  The Canadian accessions are also identical to 2 GenBank sequences derived from Nova Scotia collections recorded on MO (\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/496082\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 496082\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/496470\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 496470\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).
