This observation was noted on a foray with friends (see additional posting # 238673) but none of us could identify it immediately. Caps whitsh/cream/pale yellow with yellowish umbo and wrinkled with some cross-veining. Gills appeared to have been lighter at one point but now colored brown with spores. Also appeared separated from stipe (perhaps since these were older specimens), but evidence of some attachment can be seen in the thumbnail image. Interesting and persistent skirt ring. Copious mycelium/rhizomes at base of stipe. Odor mild, somewhat fragrant. KOH on cap a slightly greenish gray (see last image). Obtained a chocolate-brown spore print, not reddish at all.
