I plan to eventually discuss this with Dr. Tulloss (when each of us has time to do so). One difference seen between the present observation and 326553 is that 326553 shows rings on the stipes (albeit, thin and appearing to be ephemeral).  Spores for 326553 with more variable Q than the present collection, although range of length is similar for the two species.
