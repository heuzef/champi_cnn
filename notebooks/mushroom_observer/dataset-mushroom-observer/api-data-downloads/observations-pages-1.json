Not like some Lactarius or Hygrocybe, now those are orange.  But perhaps for Boletopsis slight shadings are important.  In any case, this does spark some interest in these, and it would good to find more and see what things look like in comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the initial comment was that as an orange Boletopsis this is a rare siting of B. skamaniensis (MtJoWM vol. 25 no. 4) , which in further comments this was equated with Albatrellus skamanius (MtJoWM vol. 26 no.1).  The further comments go on to say that A. skamanius is more known from the NW, and was very rare, but with further study has been seen from more places now, and they site a paper.  But with an orange color from the Sierras this is more probably Boletopsis smithii.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mentions that B. smithii is about 2 inches in size, and these were 3-4 inches in size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mentions that at the foray it was interesting that this specimen seems to have been brushed off as just another weird color variant.
