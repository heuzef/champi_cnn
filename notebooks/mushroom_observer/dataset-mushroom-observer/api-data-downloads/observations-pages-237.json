The identification process is not yet complete, because the data obtained from microscopy doesn\u0026#8217;t allow to do it.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThese specimens were treated in a topic at AscoFrance:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.ascofrance.fr/search_forum/46891\"\u003ehttp://www.ascofrance.fr/search_forum/46891\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nwhere with the help of Martin Bemmann, the name proposed here was suggested and seeming to be the best choice: \u0026#8220;Gibberella cf. zeae\u0026#8221;.

Since then I have continued to make microscopy on the specimens, which are consitent with those obtained at the time of that post, but meanwhile I got new insights on the microstrutures, that I will display at this observation and that will be updated as long as I will have new data to add.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Giberella+zeae\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eGiberella zeae\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is characterized, among other features, by the 3-septate spores; it happens that in my preliminary micro observations I could only see non-septate spores; after, with the help of cotton blue in latic acid, I could see many 1-septate spores and a single ascus where co-exist 1-, 2- and 3-septate spores (just one of this latter type, to be precise). Thus, at this stage I will not present specific photos of the spores and postpone for future updates to do it, hopping that, meanwhile, I can have some progress in this matter.

They can be distinguished only microscopically, mainly by the size of their ascospores. The spores of Chlorociboria aeruginosa are typically larger than those of C. aeruginascens. Unfortunately, I found no spores and hence it is not sure, which species the pictures show. Since the Chlorociboria aeruginosa is much less frequent in general and also in Slovenia I assume I photographed Chlorociboria aeruginascens.

in many other cases it was a question of chance to find this species. In the field I could only realise that it was a lirellate fungi/lichen, similar to some Hysteriaceae that collected recently, though the lirallae were very small.
