(rotting wood nearby).Unfortunately the specimen was lost before i could key it out. Also unfortunately i didn\u0026#8217;t get to see the base. Approx.  2\u0026quot; \u0026#8211; 3\u0026quot; tall, cap maybe 1 \u0026#8211; 1 1/2\u0026quot; across. I didn\u0026#8217;t look close at gill attachment (unfortunately!?!), but do remember they were a lovely pale shell pink. Stem and cap = Striking bright robin\u0026#8217;s egg blue color.\u003cbr /\u003e\nNever seen anything like it!

The stalk is fibrous, features darker purplish-brown scales, and in at least one specimen was somewhat hollow.  When washed, they turn yellow and as they dry, return to lavender.  When cooked, they turn permanently yellow.  The caps exceed 10cm and seem to key out to Lepista.

Central campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharacterization: Thallus pale grayish green, largely smooth but with a few conspicuous areas of whitish reticulate ridges giving the impression of  \u0026#8220;pressure ridges.\u0026#8221; Lobes broad, strongly ruffled, those on one side of the thallus seemingly rolled back and with thickened borders covered by marginal soralia, while the lobes on the other side of the thallus are much thinner and flatter and with rather regularly positioned black setae which are somewhat curly but unbranched. Exposed undersides of the lobes almost entirely white, but with a minor area stained brownish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubstrate: Found on the ground growing on a small broken branchlet about 15 mm wide and 10 cm long. Numerous similar specimens of other species of green foliose lichens on fragments of bark and twigs resting on the ground in the same area suggest that they were knocked down by recent rainstorms from nearby tall oaks and tulip-poplars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharacterization: ruffle lichen with\u003cbr /\u003e\n(1) pale silvery gray thallus with ruffled margins\u003cbr /\u003e\n(2) ascendent marginal lobes displaying extensive white patches on their undersurfaces\u003cbr /\u003e\n(3) prominent marginal cilia\u003cbr /\u003e\n(4) lumpy, irregularly coallescing soredial patches tracking the margins of ascendent lobes\u003cbr /\u003e\n(5) cortex K+ yellow (atranorin)\u003cbr /\u003e\n(6) medulla K+ yellow turning red\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReferences:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.sharnoffphotos.com/lichensE/parmotrema_hypotropum.html\"\u003eSharnoff\u0026#8217;s Parmotrema hypotropum gallery\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://symbiota.org/nalichens/taxa/index.php?taxon=54552\"\u003eCNALH images, description, and locality map\u003c/a\u003e, and a larger, \u003ca href=\"http://symbiota.org/nalichens/collections/maps/googlemap.php?usecookies=false\u0026type=3\u0026db=all\u0026thes=on\u0026taxa=Parmotrema%20hypotropum\"\u003einteractive locality map\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommon name: powdered ruffle lichen\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":955,"consensus_id":12228,"consensus_name":"Parmotrema hypotropum","location_id":446,"location_name":"Sewanee, Franklin Co., Tennessee, USA","primary_image_id":35338},{"id":17501,"type":"observation","date":"2009-01-28","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.26967,"created_at":"2009-01-29T06:53:25.000Z","updated_at":"2021-12-17T17:16:13.000Z","number_of_views":66,"last_viewed":"2023-12-31T08:17:01.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003e[admin \u0026#8211; Sat Aug 14 02:01:39 +0000 2010]: Changed location name from \u0026#8216;Jughandle State Park, Mendocino CO, CA\u0026#8217; to \u0026#8216;Jug Handle State Reserve, Mendocino Co., California, USA\u0026#8217;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":746,"consensus_id":672,"consensus_name":"Oligoporus fragilis","location_id":21798,"location_name":"Jug Handle State Natural Reserve (Jughandle State Reserve), Mendocino Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":35339},{"id":17502,"type":"observation","date":"2009-01-28","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.2697,"created_at":"2009-01-29T07:04:35.000Z","updated_at":"2021-12-17T17:16:14.000Z","number_of_views":29,"last_viewed":"2024-01-01T01:35:32.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003e[admin \u0026#8211; Sat Aug 14 02:01:39 +0000 2010]: Changed location name from \u0026#8216;Jughandle State Park, Mendocino CO, CA\u0026#8217; to \u0026#8216;Jug Handle State Reserve, Mendocino Co., California, USA\u0026#8217;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":746,"consensus_id":411,"consensus_name":"Trichaptum abietinum","location_id":21798,"location_name":"Jug Handle State Natural Reserve (Jughandle State Reserve), Mendocino Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":35341}],"run_time":1.4546375}
