The species is very similar to closely related Hemileccinum depilatum (Redeuilh) Šutara. The most important distinguishing traits are pilei surface and microscopic structure of pilei cutis. The latter species usually looks like having \u0026#8216;hammered\u0026#8217; pileus. However, the only sure way to differentiate them is microscopic structure of their pilei cuticle.
