It has a very strong and unpleasant smell that can often be described as sickeningly sweet. Specimens are often found in clusters of four or more laterally attached caps. Occasionally a single, rosette-shaped pileus can be found; esp. in a young specimen. Cap size varies from 10 to 36cm in mature fruiting bodies. Pileus can be concave or depressed when viewed from above and older samples may have the appearance of a rudimentary stalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flesh of the fruiting body is generally a light cream color and is thick, tough and fibrous. Mature specimens can reach a thickness of up to five cm. The spore bearing surface is usually a clean white with 3-5 pores per mm2.

It is found growing on the lower area of the trunks of hardwoods. It seems to favor areas of the tree that have sustained injury with noticeable portions of the tree’s bark removed. P. admirabilus is not known to be edible and has no current economic value or use to humans. The specimen are relatively rare but when found in a particular area can be quite common in the surrounding acres. This is thought to be due to its favoring injured, living hardwoods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP. admirabilis is most commonly mistaken to be Polypourous coronadensis.

I\u0026#8217;ve looked thru all my references and really don\u0026#8217;t have this strange creature nailed down.  So here goes \u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was found Sept 3rd, 2008 in Boone Co. (Central) Missouri on a grassy slope between a gravel path and a mixed hardwood forest area.  It is approximately 3-4\u0026quot; tall, 2-3\u0026quot; across.  I didn\u0026#8217;t dig it up.  I don\u0026#8217;t have a sample, and didn\u0026#8217;t get spore print.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looks like a funnel-shaped mushroom with another fungus growing on it.  It appears to grow around grass with the result of blades of grass sticking thru it.  The under surface appears to be solid white pores in an irregular or maze-like pattern.  The upper surface is white becoming a gelatinous, hairy flesh color towards the center.  The lower stalk area appears covered with this same gelatinous, hairy flesh-colored material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closest resemblance I could find is Tremella concrescens which is a jelly which grows around stems, leaves, twigs, etc.  (Ref. Bessette (2) \u0026amp; Fishcer, p. 433 (text) and p. 436 (picture))  However this specimen has a definite (funnel) shape, and the jelly doesn\u0026#8217;t, on it\u0026#8217;s own.  Perhaps this is growing on a funnel-shaped mushroom such as a Clitocybe or a vase-shaped polypore, but I could find no mention of this jelly growing on other mushrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther possibilities I could find were Caloporus dichrous (Ref. Audubon p.449) which is pinkish buff and white colored, but the cap is said to be white with the tubes being pinkish buff.  The \u0026#8216;Candied (Apricot) Jelly Fungus\u0026#8217; or Phologiotis helvelloides is another possibility with a funnel shape and gelatinous flesh, except that is said to be found under confir (Ref. Phillips p.300).  Finally, the \u0026#8216;Orange Peel Fungus\u0026#8217; or Aleuria aurantia has a fleshy surface and can be whitish (Ref. Phillips p.306).  But none of these possibilities really seem to fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, M.O. community, whadya think ???\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for you consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMOFunGuy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[admin \u0026#8211; Sat Aug 14 01:58:45 +0000 2010]: Changed location name from \u0026#8216;Boone Co., (Central) Missouri, USA\u0026#8217; to \u0026#8216;Boone Co., Missouri, USA\u0026#8217;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":846,"consensus_id":1104,"consensus_name":"Abortiporus biennis","location_id":1107,"location_name":"Boone Co., Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":32610},{"id":15540,"type":"observation","date":"2008-12-18","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.45635,"created_at":"2008-12-18T21:40:45.000Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T22:16:50.000Z","number_of_views":42,"last_viewed":"2023-12-29T03:25:50.000Z","owner_id":746,"consensus_id":482,"consensus_name":"Hygrophorus bakerensis","location_id":4653,"location_name":"Mendocino, Mendocino Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":32613},{"id":15541,"type":"observation","date":"2008-12-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.42642,"created_at":"2008-12-18T22:29:15.000Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T00:36:27.000Z","number_of_views":113,"last_viewed":"2024-04-10T01:13:23.000Z","owner_id":43,"consensus_id":671,"consensus_name":"Micromphale sequoiae","location_id":12838,"location_name":"Sebastopol, Sonoma Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":32614},{"id":15542,"type":"observation","date":"2008-12-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.72181,"created_at":"2008-12-18T22:30:51.000Z","updated_at":"2018-01-03T15:40:11.000Z","number_of_views":87,"last_viewed":"2024-03-30T13:41:54.000Z","owner_id":43,"consensus_id":165,"consensus_name":"Marasmius quercophilus","location_id":12838,"location_name":"Sebastopol, Sonoma Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":32616},{"id":15543,"type":"observation","date":"2008-12-10","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.50851,"created_at":"2008-12-18T22:56:35.000Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T13:36:56.000Z","number_of_views":77,"last_viewed":"2024-02-02T16:11:06.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound by checking out a slight lump in the leaf litter.
