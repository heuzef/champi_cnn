The inconspicuous thallus is grayish with sometimes pink tint but often covered by dark layer of cyanobacteria, which makes its appearance black (Ref.:1). It is often found together with Trentepohlia aurea, an orange filamentous algae capable to live outside water (see orange tufts on pictures 11b and 12b). The photobiont of Gyalecta jenensis is also Trentepohlia algae. The lichen was in damp state when photographed.

Its apothecia measure less than 1 mm in diameter. So, it is easy to overlook it. To use a hand lens for observation is a must. The species can be recognized by its yellow or yellow-greenish thallus, which consists of tiny corticated granules and yellow apothecia (if present). It grows on broadleaf tree bark.  However, there exist several similar minute, yellow species, hence a mistake in determination cannot be excluded. Observing asci, which are 12- to 32-spored in Candelariella xanthostigma would make the determination reliable. Several specimens were found on this tree, mostly on thinner branches. Most of them were sterile (yellow granules only).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":8205,"consensus_name":"Candelariella xanthostigma","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":846630},{"id":308958,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-21","latitude":"46.4129","longitude":"16.2435","altitude":212,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.30755,"created_at":"2018-02-17T09:12:30.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-17T09:12:32.000Z","number_of_views":24,"last_viewed":"2024-01-07T04:48:28.000Z","owner_id":10878,"consensus_id":21238,"consensus_name":"Byssomerulius corium","location_id":671,"location_name":"Slovenia","primary_image_id":846635},{"id":308959,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-18","latitude":"46.4129","longitude":"16.2435","altitude":212,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.31732,"created_at":"2018-02-17T09:20:33.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-17T09:20:38.000Z","number_of_views":62,"last_viewed":"2024-04-06T09:08:39.000Z","owner_id":10878,"consensus_id":16341,"consensus_name":"Gloeophyllum abietinum","location_id":671,"location_name":"Slovenia","primary_image_id":846637},{"id":308960,"type":"observation","date":"2018-02-04","latitude":"46.4129","longitude":"16.2435","altitude":212,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.32565,"created_at":"2018-02-17T09:26:38.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-17T09:26:45.000Z","number_of_views":57,"last_viewed":"2024-02-21T19:30:05.000Z","owner_id":10878,"consensus_id":4889,"consensus_name":"Trametes ochracea","location_id":671,"location_name":"Slovenia","primary_image_id":846640},{"id":308961,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-20","latitude":"46.4285","longitude":"16.2345","altitude":236,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.33079,"created_at":"2018-02-17T09:32:22.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-17T09:32:25.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2023-12-25T07:45:01.000Z","owner_id":10878,"consensus_id":42,"consensus_name":"Trametes versicolor","location_id":671,"location_name":"Slovenia","primary_image_id":846643},{"id":308962,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-07","latitude":"46.4285","longitude":"16.2345","altitude":236,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.33926,"created_at":"2018-02-17T09:47:11.000Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T10:22:01.000Z","number_of_views":78,"last_viewed":"2024-04-10T08:58:57.000Z","owner_id":10878,"consensus_id":2305,"consensus_name":"Ganoderma adspersum","location_id":671,"location_name":"Slovenia","primary_image_id":846649},{"id":308963,"type":"observation","date":"2018-01-07","latitude":"46.4285","longitude":"16.2345","altitude":236,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.34329,"created_at":"2018-02-17T09:49:14.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-17T09:49:17.000Z","number_of_views":27,"last_viewed":"2024-04-10T05:46:30.000Z","owner_id":10878,"consensus_id":1479,"consensus_name":"Auricularia mesenterica group","location_id":671,"location_name":"Slovenia","primary_image_id":846654},{"id":308964,"type":"observation","date":"2018-02-10","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70406,"created_at":"2018-02-17T09:50:25.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T22:38:49.000Z","number_of_views":86,"last_viewed":"2023-12-28T16:18:56.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing side by side with \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Piloderma+byssinum\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePiloderma byssinum\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/308750\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eObservation 308750\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) on the underside of a log which I cannot identify, but most likely it would be tanoak or redwood.

middle-size but beautiful and conspicuous lichen. Its rosettes 2-7(10) cm in diameter are characteristic by its light mineral-gray to whitish appearance with blue tint, appressed to substrate lobes with a thin, dark edge and few short cilia. Thallus underside is black (but lighter near the edge) with crowded, simple, black rhizines. The species loves precipitations. So, no wander it feels well in Trenta valley with its about 3.000 mm (120 inches) of rain per year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there exists another, more frequent species, Parmelina tiliacea, which is very similar to Parmelina pastillifera. It is practically impossible to distinguish both by habit only. In spite of this, they can be easily separated by observing their isidia (magnifying glass required). Both species have isidia when grown up. Parmelina pastillifera has black, button- or bun-shaped isidia, many of them are stalked. When they break off a small, white scar remains on the thallus surface (Ref.: 2) (see picture 7). On the other side Parmelina tiliacea has dark brown, cylindrical or coralloid isidia. Both species are rather rare and on the Red List at least in Germany (Ref.:5). In this observation many specimens were growing on branches (having 2–4 cm in diameter) of this tree. All of them were sterile (without apothecia), which is almost always the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro

After longer rains, when it is soaked with rain it is deep green and beautiful, while when dry, it is dark brown, brown-grayish or gray and much less attractive. The species can be recognized by: usually abundant apothecia (see Pic.3), thallus without soralia, soredia, maculae or cilia and abundant black, bottle-brush-like rhizines (see Pic.10) forming a dense mat on the underside of the thallus (see Pic.8). Thallus underside is dark in older parts but much lighter toward the edges and rhizines are almost simple on the thallus margins.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe upper canopy branches of the tree examined were full of specimens of this species. Pictures taken after several rainy days, except Pic.9 and 17, which show dry specimen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro
