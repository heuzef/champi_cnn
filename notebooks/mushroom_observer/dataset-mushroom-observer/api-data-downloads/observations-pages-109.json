OSU project mentions that L. conizaeoides \u0026#8220;appears to have colonized a significant area in western Oregon and Washington\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;is now known from numerous sites in Seattle\u0026#8221; including 1 telephone pole. In West Seattle I find it on a great number, perhaps hundreds, of old creosoted power poles, which are now being replaced.

It has never been satisfactorily determined whether it has a requirement for SO2 or is responding to the lack of competition…\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe species has an interesting history. The earliest British specimen is a collection made by the Rev. Bloxam from a fir tree at Twycross in Leicestershire around 1861; by 1870 it had been recorded from Buxton, Manchester, London and Hampshire, spreading rapidly with the rise in background air pollution as the Industrial Revolution gathered pace. It is probably an introduced species whose natural habitat, near sulphur springs in Iceland, preadapted it for a rapid invasion of coal and oil-burning areas.\u0026#8221; (my bold)\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn The Lichen Hunters Gilbert (2004) comments \u0026#8220;Lizard Point is a sordid place.
