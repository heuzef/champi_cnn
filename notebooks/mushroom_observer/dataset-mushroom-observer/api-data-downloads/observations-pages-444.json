The different colors on each individual are discreetly marked by the striations (i.e. the colors do not \u0026#8220;blend\u0026#8221; from dark to light). The underside is white to light beige. Individual caps range in width from \u0026lt;1cm to 6cm wide. (In some cases, adjacent individuals are fused together, giving them the appearance of one large individual with a width exceeding 6cm.) Length from point of attachment to the edge ranges from \u0026lt;1cm in smaller individuals to ~3cm in the largest individuals.

Attachment of the first individual appears to be surface-level (i.e. not penetrating past the bark), however I did notice some mycelial penetration into the wood upon removal of the second specimen. Close inspection of the underside of caps revealed small orange larvae (\u0026lt;1mm in length).  These larvae are abundant on the surface of the dead branch, and present on the underside of every mushroom cap that I observed. Individual larva can occasionally be found on the upper surface of caps, and I noticed one or two on the surface of a leaf located right next to the log, but they are primarily concentrated on the log and undersides of the mushroom caps.

Immature specimens are firm and without a stem. They are attached to the soil by a thread of fiber that resembles a short root. The immature ones have a diameter of 1 1/2 to 2\u0026quot;, are roughly spherical, white, and the surface looks a lot like brie. As it matures, the surface begins to separate, revealing a crack about 1/4\u0026quot; deep, exposing  a pastel yellowish or pinkish colored lattice. This inner lattice expands to form a pale orange sphere the size of a softball. When mature, it smells like carrion. Substrate was very moist soil and the area would be in full-time shade.  In its mature stage it is very fragile. A community of about 10 of these in different stages were growing near some shrubs that are common around the paddocks but I don\u0026#8217;t yet know the name.
