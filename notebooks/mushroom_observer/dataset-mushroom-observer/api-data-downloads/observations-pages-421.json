I found the little group growing on a decaying oak branch. The stwms were anywhere from 1.5- 5cm long and the caps 1-3cm in diameter. The stems have a veil and become bulbous at the end. The caps are a saucer shaped with a blunt tip. The gills are white and the cap is brighter yellow around the edge and starts to darken and turn into a rusty orange color and some dark brown and black spots seem to devolop on the more mature specimens cap. The caps end with some small pointed frill along the edge of the cap, cap has scales. Gills did not seem attached to stem and were tightly grouped together.\n\u003cp\u003eI have not been able to obtain a spore print yet, and from the feild they were carried in a tissue in a straw hat for a 2 miles . I would assume if this specimen was in fact Hypholoma acutum, that it would leave black spore traces but it did not.

The overall impression of the shape may be compared to a kite in flight. Using my old monocular scope (for photos) most of the spores are visible only as the the single guttules, which creates the illusion that the spores are very small and roughly globose. This situation is not improved by mounting in a stain; mounted in either of Congo red or cotton blue the guttule is enhanced and the surrounding region and walls are obscured. Best views were achieved using 4% KOH or H2O. Last photo shows a zoom on a few spores in H2O that I managed to focus in with the old scope.
