This is because ITS, for some reason, is almost always highly polypmorphic in amanitas from sect. \u003ccite\u003eLepidella\u003c/cite\u003e sensu Bas, to which this species belongs based on the gross morphology.  While LSU can, too, suffer from heterogeneity in lepidellas, it’s typically much better behaved.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe LSU amplicon targeted by Dr. Kudzma is apparently between the LSU0F and LR5 primers.  This stretch of the locus is typically 950-960 bps long.  However, the LSU0F (forward read) and LR22 (reverse read) primers were used for sequencing.  It is not clear why this primer combo was chosen because the LR22 reverse read originates ~370 bps away from the start of the locus and the forward LSU0F read always captures this region well in the absence of heterogeneity.  Thus, I would have much preferred a reverse read from LR5 because not only it would normally overlap with the forward read for a few hundred bps, but it would also deliver a much sharper 3’ end of the sequence than the “tired” LSU0F.\u003cbr /\u003e\nFrustratingly, the forward read was found to become heterogeneous at position #474 (from the start of the locus) in a poly-T repeat (Fig. 1).  However, unlike the typical 1-base frame shift often seen, this turned out to be a 2-base frame shift! While I’ve seen these a few times before in ITS of boletes and/or amanitas, I never had to deal with them because I would have a reverse read to stitch with a forward one at the point of heterogeneity (the “joined contig” scenario).  Here, there was no complementary reverse read to save me, and this is where a read from LR5 would have really helped!  Naturally, calling the peaks of a mixture of two haplotypes, one of which is lengthened by the insertion of two bases, is not a fun thing to deal with, especially when one is tasked to screen hundreds of peaks by means of being able to visually recognize and follow a stable and predictable pattern of colored overlapping curves.  This was further compounded by the fact that the two haplotypes were a ~1:1 mix, so I couldn’t use peak size/height to my advantage.  Reluctantly, I gave the manual resolution of the two haplotypes a try and quickly convinced myself that it was doable.  Still, it took me a very long time to finish this job and to be convinced of its quality, but I was able to add almost 470 bases from the point of heterogeneity to the point where the peaks\u0026#8217; shape got too broad for unambiguous interpretation.  Reported here is the shorter haplotype.  The sequence also has three ambiguous positions visible in the unscrambled part of the LSU0F read; two of these, \u0026#8220;Y\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;W\u0026#8221;, are located very close to the point of sequence “derailment” (Fig. 1).\u003cbr /\u003e\nA BLASTn-100 of this sequence gave two accessions of a nameless amanita from China, MW016757 \u0026amp; MW016758, as top hits at 98.6-98.7% similarity.  Sequence alignment showed that MO376018 and the Asian taxon have 7 hard mismatches and 4 soft mismatches (gaps \u0026amp; ambiguities).  I checked these positions, most of which occur in the scrambled region, and confirmed them to be real, i.e., no mistakes made in my base assignments.  The two GenBank accessions reference an unpublished work titled “\u003ccite\u003eAmanita tangconc\u003c/cite\u003e and \u003ccite\u003eAmanita baltaradicata\u003c/cite\u003e, two new species of \u003ccite\u003eAmanita\u003c/cite\u003e section \u003ccite\u003eRoanokenses\u003c/cite\u003e from China”.
