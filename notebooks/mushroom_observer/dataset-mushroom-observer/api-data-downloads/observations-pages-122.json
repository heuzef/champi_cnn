All asci in a tissue sample I examined were sterile. This is not unusual (see Ref.:7.) since fertile asci can be found only in fully mature sporocarps. In spite of that there were several scattered spores found in the sample taken from the fertile surface with a soft wet tip of a brush (picture of the spores is a CS combo!). However, only a few were fusiform with apiculi as it should be the case with Discina ancilis. Their dimensions fit more or less to the expected dimensions. The length of the rest of the spores is OK, but they are significantly too wide and of untypical shape. Possibly they belong to another fungus (?). Oil drops are also missing. Possibly these drops develop only in fully mature spores? Asci and paraphyses dimensions fit to expectations. Very similar Disciotis venosa has much smaller spores and distinct smell on chlorine.

I found more in that area, spread out on a 50 meter radius (as happens with most boletus species when they multiply). Also, found some in the same region growing in the grass, out in the open, not in the shade. The cap is light orange, it looks almost like a piece of bread to me, and the meat is very soft, also a bit porous, not that elastic. The thickness of the cap is more than 5 millimeters to the edge, a key difference that sets it apart from a closely related species. The stem has tough, stringy meat, it has a rough surface, like having bits partly shaved off that are darker in color (dark brown to black). The \u0026#8220;gills\u0026#8221; form a reverse funnel shape close to where the stem meets the cap, they are quite fine. Also, the cap can detach quite easily from the stem when picking, leaving a round shape on the stem.

This one I see in Wisconsin every year (several disparate sites), with mixed oak and conifers. It is very robust with caps becoming 8 inches across or more and a very stout stem. Saccate volva is robust but not especially deep. It is KOH positive, turning bright yellow on cap immediately. Others have offered other names including A elliptosperma (but that species is reportedly KOH negative).\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2043,"consensus_id":41400,"consensus_name":"Amanita suballiacea","location_id":8032,"location_name":"Cable, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":369360},{"id":146239,"type":"observation","date":"2013-09-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.80572,"created_at":"2013-09-23T19:08:07.000Z","updated_at":"2013-10-03T23:24:25.000Z","number_of_views":105,"last_viewed":"2023-08-17T04:04:26.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing on hardwood.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4401,"consensus_id":6264,"consensus_name":"Gymnopilus luteoviridis","location_id":6870,"location_name":"San Marcos, Texas, USA","primary_image_id":369362},{"id":146240,"type":"observation","date":"2013-09-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.81891,"created_at":"2013-09-23T19:18:21.000Z","updated_at":"2016-03-26T15:23:32.000Z","number_of_views":36,"last_viewed":"2023-12-21T14:28:45.000Z","owner_id":2043,"consensus_id":3771,"consensus_name":"Suillus acidus","location_id":8032,"location_name":"Cable, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":369367},{"id":146241,"type":"observation","date":"2013-09-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.80572,"created_at":"2013-09-23T19:36:15.000Z","updated_at":"2013-10-03T23:21:16.000Z","number_of_views":329,"last_viewed":"2024-04-16T14:08:52.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing from telephone pole.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4401,"consensus_id":6264,"consensus_name":"Gymnopilus luteoviridis","location_id":6870,"location_name":"San Marcos, Texas, USA","primary_image_id":369368},{"id":146242,"type":"observation","date":"2013-09-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.45621,"created_at":"2013-09-23T19:43:15.000Z","updated_at":"2013-09-23T19:43:22.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2024-02-26T04:37:22.000Z","owner_id":4401,"consensus_id":3007,"consensus_name":"Marasmius siccus","location_id":6870,"location_name":"San Marcos, Texas, USA","primary_image_id":369374},{"id":146243,"type":"observation","date":"2013-09-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.7608,"created_at":"2013-09-23T19:56:18.000Z","updated_at":"2016-01-22T08:49:12.000Z","number_of_views":54,"last_viewed":"2023-12-29T10:25:16.000Z","owner_id":4401,"consensus_id":28045,"consensus_name":"Marasmiaceae","location_id":6870,"location_name":"San Marcos, Texas, USA","primary_image_id":369377},{"id":146244,"type":"observation","date":"2013-09-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.77526,"created_at":"2013-09-23T20:05:04.000Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T06:15:04.000Z","number_of_views":139,"last_viewed":"2024-04-07T12:45:03.000Z","owner_id":4401,"consensus_id":29280,"consensus_name":"Chlorophyllum hortense","location_id":6870,"location_name":"San Marcos, Texas, USA","primary_image_id":369378}],"run_time":1.440444062}
