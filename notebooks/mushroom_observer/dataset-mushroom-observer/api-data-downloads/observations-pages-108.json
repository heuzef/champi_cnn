In particular, this book describes the existing species of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Peltigera\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePeltigera\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. According to it there are 23 species of that genus in the Iberian Peninsula, 14 of which in Portugal. I divided these in two groups, the first from places where I already made observations, and the second group with the remaining.

I have photographed these fungi before but identification was difficult due to the lack of information.  I hope I have improved on the situation.  I did think when I revisited the site that these were the same as the previous fungi, but now I am not sure. Both lots were abundant in small groups in this recently flooded bank up from the fresh water stream.  They only seem to grow in one particular area and I cannot discern any difference in the type of trees in the area. It may have something to do with the type of soil. It does appear to be volcanic in that the colour is redish brown.  The images I refer to are in 130724.
