As the light through the canopy kept changing, the reflected light from the globules of coloured liquid presented me with a never ending cathedral like display of luminance and rays of light, that was impossible to capture with a mere camera. I watched this display for some time and the exhilaration was incredible. I must admit the adrenalin was really pumping. Needless to say I did take some out of focus images in my eagerness to capture every moment. Saying this, the beauty is only in the eye of the beholder.(so I am told).\u003cbr /\u003e\n I took many images, some good, some bad. As the light was changing continually I had great difficulty in getting sharp images when shooting long exposures. (so much for my idea on a benchmark for colour calibrating temperature of images.)\u003cbr /\u003e\n In this situation any number of images were correctly balanced and  represented in calibrated colour, but none were the same as can be easily seen in the loaded images.. \u003cbr /\u003e\nThe liquid I thought may have been raindrops captured and stored during the torrential rain we have been receiving. I touched the liquid, and rubbed it between my fingers. Surprisingly it was not sticky, but did leave a very slight resin feeling when my fingers began to dry. I could not detect any specific aroma to mention.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt was also interesting to note that the droplets were tan coloured and were even attached to the underside of the body in places where the surface was dark. The dark surface area had a velvet touch and the body of the fungi was quite firm. The pores appeared to be irregular and had no real pattern. The specimen was on the base section of a large eucalyptus, and was a single specimen, except for the small specimen to the l.h.s. of the main body.  I broke the smaller section away from the trunk and cut it in half. This did not reveal much to me and the image I took of this was not sharp. Some of the base of the fungi remained attached to the trunk.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe overall width of this fungi was approximately 7-8 inches across, but it was only about 5 inches in height. It had what would be described as a \u0026#8220;squat habit\u0026#8221;.\u003cbr /\u003e\n The water globules were about standard pencil size.

All my previous examples never displayed this feature. One of the differences is this group were found in a Coastal Eucalypt reserve, where-as the others were found in the rainforest areas of Swans Crossing and Comboyne State Forest. The other difference which was quite outstanding was the saturation of colour in the younger specimens. I have shown as wide a variety as possible of this current collection. Clive has mentioned the differences in species on a couple of occasions also. I do believe that this group is different to the previous collection.(7732). One other thing that I noticed was the abundance of this species, where as in the rain forest I usually only see one or at the most two in any area. I had no difficulty in finding up to 15 examples in various stages of growth. I have nominated two species which have been discussed before in relation to the naming.

If uprooted, they dry out and shrivel up, so they must continue to draw moisture from underground during their life-span.

The cap is darker brown than the rest. Dark brown cells elongate and divide first one way, then at right angles, while paler ones elongate and divide mainly vertically, though a bit more horizontally the higher they are. This gives: a pale stem that eventually gets wrinkled a bit toward the top, or even forked, and a hollow brown ball on the top that inflates, but collapses and gets wrinkled up due to its own weight. Furthermore, in expanding everywhere, it is trying to become a hyperbolic manifold, which won\u0026#8217;t fit in flat 3-D space without crumpling up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA simple way to get a large surface area.
