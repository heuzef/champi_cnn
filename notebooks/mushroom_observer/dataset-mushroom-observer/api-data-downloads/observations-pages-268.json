It shares typical Lepista species habit but it is somewhat smaller than more frequent and better known Lepista nuda or Lepista nebularis. Gills are easy to separate from trama as in most Lepista species. The fungus was separate from Lepista genus and put into Paralepista genus only in the year 2012 based on DNA evidence. Before that various genus and species names had been used and long, long debates about its taxonomy took place.  \u003cbr /\u003e\nGrowing in groups, many fruit bodies found; pileus diameter 2.8 \u0026#8211; 6 cm; flesh watery, brittle; SP white with a slight orange-pink tint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":33369,"consensus_name":"Paralepista flaccida","location_id":673,"location_name":"Bovec basin, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":823278},{"id":302050,"type":"observation","date":"2017-12-09","latitude":"42.1267","longitude":"-123.5632","altitude":445,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.63992,"created_at":"2017-12-09T21:59:09.000Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T17:31:57.000Z","number_of_views":143,"last_viewed":"2023-08-17T05:55:34.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound these in the dunes not sure what they are.
