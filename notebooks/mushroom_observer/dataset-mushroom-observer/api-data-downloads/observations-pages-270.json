Only Fomitopsis pinicola living on dead Picea abies is eventually more frequent and also more noticeable with its orange-red rim of the pilei. This is so because deteriorated and rotten Picea abies trees and trunks are in abundance here. Namely, Picea abies is not really a \u0026#8216;suitable\u0026#8217; species for this habitat and climate and hardly thrives bountifully in this region. Also, many trees now grow on former pastures, now abandoned for decades, which were covered with only a very thin layer of soil. Combined with their shallow root system they are almost regularly toppled by strong winds when they become a few decades old. Presence of many dead Picea abies trunks here around is a stage of natural forest succession process. This conifer is gradually replaced by Fagus sylvatica trees, which is the species truly \u0026#8216;at home\u0026#8217; in Trenta valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sporocarps on the pictures were found on an old, dead Fagus sylvatica tree. There were more than 35 pilei present, from young ones to very old, decayed ones. The largest is 37 cm wide, 34 cm high and 22 cm thick!
