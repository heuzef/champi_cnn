They grow mostly in woods but one can find them also on open places. Particularly the green ones are beautiful when moist and richly developed. To recognize them on genus level is not at all a problem. However, to determine them correctly (particularly gray-brown ones) on species level is sometimes quite a challenge, more so, if the thali are sterile that is without apothecia. The large difference in their appearance between being in dry or moist state are often striking. So, wrong determinations are quite common. Peltigera canina is a species, which is frequently confused with others, most often with very similar (and much more frequent) Peltigera membranacea. Peltigera canina can be distinguished from other species by irregular, shaggy, markedly bushy, confluent at the base, white rhizines and fuzzy tomentum on the upper side of the lobes. The underside has flattened, smooth and whitish veins (except sometimes in the middle of the thallus where they may be darker). Quite rare, roundish and very dark brown to black apothecia are also typical. Richly branched, woolly rhizines are most diagnostic (Ref.:1.) (see Fig.3a.). However, this rhizines form is not the only one present. Often several other shapes, including those common to Peltigera membranacea, are present or even dominant. Yet, no other Peltigera species has rhizines of this typical appearance than Peltigera canina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lichen was one time used to treat rabies because the rhizines supposedly look like dogs\u0026#8217; teeth (Ref.:4.).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRef.:\u003cbr /\u003e\n(1) C.W.Smith, et all, The lichens of Great Britain and Ireland,The British Lichen \u003cbr /\u003e\nSociety (2009), p 667.\u003cbr /\u003e\n(2) I.M.
