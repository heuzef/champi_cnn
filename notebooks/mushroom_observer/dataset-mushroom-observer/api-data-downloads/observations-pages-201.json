had quite a few tree falls of mature oaks and hickories in the last several years. Most of these trees were blown down, pulling up a root ball that elevates the trunk from the ground for many years. I\u0026#8217;ve noticed a whitish curst on the lower sides and bottoms of many of the trees while the bark is still on. It\u0026#8217;s an early colonizer along with Stereum ostrea and other bracket fungi. Unlike the brackets, the whitish crust causes the bark to loosen such that you can (with a knife and some effort) usually rip pieces of thick bark off, revealing moist degrading wood below. Today I took photos of three fallen trees, a Southern Red Oak (Quercus flacata) and two Northern Red Oaks (Q. rubra), capturing images of the crust in various states.

This beautiful ascomycete is suspected of being one of the many dual pathogenic clavicipitalean fungi which prey upon both scale insects and their plant hosts.  Initial inclinations were that the collection may consist of two species, but two fruiting bodies appear to be at least somewhat transitional between the lighter and darker forms.  The similarity in both spore shape/length (see thread-like spores in images 5 and 7) and context tissue (images 6 and 8) also support this conclusion.

Thalline margin present, but outside and beneath the proper margin, always with whitish-grey material on it that superficially resembles crusty pruina but I think is something else, maybe remnant thallus material?

fresh specimen sent to me, collected in Florida. Fairly confident this is G.ravenelii since I cannot find any melanoid bands in the context or stipe of the mushroom. Preliminary microscopy was largely inconclusive with too few spores being found, but what spores I did find were of the smooth type as I have seen in other ravenelii specimens. Though only one was shaped in a way that I would call it elongated. But only about three spores were seen and I did not bother measuring them. Once the mushroom has dried I will try to scrape more spores from the dried surface as well as try to extract some from the pore tubes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral tissue samples were placed on agar.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":5694,"consensus_id":2217,"consensus_name":"Ganoderma curtisii","location_id":1469,"location_name":"Ocala National Forest, Marion Co., Florida, USA","primary_image_id":597506},{"id":230875,"type":"observation","date":"2016-01-30","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.72735,"created_at":"2016-02-07T21:12:18.000Z","updated_at":"2016-02-07T21:33:54.000Z","number_of_views":19,"last_viewed":"2022-06-09T22:23:19.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing on the bark of chestnut\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2250,"consensus_id":6160,"consensus_name":"Nephroma laevigatum","location_id":6880,"location_name":"Serra de Montejunto, Portugal","primary_image_id":597513},{"id":230876,"type":"observation","date":"2016-01-30","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.71,"created_at":"2016-02-07T21:13:42.000Z","updated_at":"2016-02-07T21:18:32.000Z","number_of_views":52,"last_viewed":"2023-03-04T02:21:49.000Z","owner_id":164,"consensus_id":29290,"consensus_name":"Russula maculata group","location_id":479,"location_name":"Anthony Chabot Regional Park, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":597516},{"id":230877,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-04","latitude":"37.3467","longitude":"-76.539","altitude":15,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.59524,"created_at":"2016-02-07T21:15:55.000Z","updated_at":"2016-02-07T21:16:00.000Z","number_of_views":53,"last_viewed":"2024-04-09T21:43:05.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eon twig of young \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Quercus+rubra\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eQuercus rubra\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e; young mixed forest with \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Quercus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eQuercus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Liquidambar\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eLiquidambar\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Acer\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eAcer\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pinus+taeda\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePinus taeda\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and dense understory of shrubs and vines, especially \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Toxicodendron+radicans\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eToxicodendron radicans\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e; forest southeast of junction of Hickory Fork Road and Cedar Bush Road\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealgae absent, apothecia ~round black thin, asci pear-shaped, spores 3-septate with upper two wide than lower two thin-walled ~16\u0026#215;8um but probably somewhat immature still\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edet. by Richard Harris as \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Tomasellia+americana\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eTomasellia americana\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in 2015, originally \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Arthonia+punctiformis\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eArthonia punctiformis\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":252,"consensus_id":14280,"consensus_name":"Tomasellia americana","location_id":13177,"location_name":"Gloucester Co., Virginia, USA","primary_image_id":597519},{"id":230878,"type":"observation","date":"2016-02-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.86828,"created_at":"2016-02-07T21:17:47.000Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T04:50:38.000Z","number_of_views":272,"last_viewed":"2024-03-29T03:26:28.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn pieces of decaying wood (fallen down oak), on the ground.
