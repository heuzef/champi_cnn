The caps were 15-80 mmin width x 14-15 mm high. The width of the stipe at the base was 5-8 mm in diameter and their lenghts ranged from 35-80 mm.  Lamellae width was 3-8 mm x 10-30 mm long. Trama thickness was less than 1mm to 2 mm, and the width of the stipe at the apex was 3-8 mm.  The pileus was narrowly convex to broadly convex, and some were slightly umbonate. The pilei were orbicular, unicolorous, and had reddish-brown erect fibrils on the disc.  The pileal margins were incurved to decurved; entire on young specimens, slightly lacerate on older specimens,and was appendiculate on some. Pileal surfaces were dull, and dry to moist, and had innate appressed fibrils on them. Pileal flesh was white in young and off-white in old specimens; flesh less than 1mm-1mm, at the margin and 1-2 mm in the center. Trama soft, smelled pleasant, and had a mild taste.  The gills were adnexed, close to subdistant, moderately broad, and marginate \u0026#8211; being white against a pinkish-brown face- which was dull, moist to slippery and mottled white on a brown background.  Stipe cenrally attached with a white downy base, abundant basal tomentum with yellowish-white rhizomorphs. The stipes were terete, and equal to tapered in either direction. There were very fine, innate, dark fibrils above an evanescent, cortinoid ring, while below it there were long dark hairs- some appressed- while others were long and flexible.  Stipes were fibrous and hollow.  The apex of the stipe had a whitish superior cortina which left an evanescent ring which turned black from the spores.  Growth habit was stipitate, and cespitos to gregarious. On grass near rhododendrons, and close to Alberta Spruce and Japanese Red Maple.  Spore print grayish-black to black.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1685,"consensus_id":1140,"consensus_name":"Lacrymaria lacrymabunda","location_id":6896,"location_name":"85 Barney St., Larksville, Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":378532},{"id":149520,"type":"observation","date":"2013-10-21","latitude":"19.0412","longitude":"-99.7867","altitude":3043,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.73476,"created_at":"2013-10-22T02:07:23.000Z","updated_at":"2013-12-03T05:04:49.000Z","number_of_views":61,"last_viewed":"2023-11-19T05:32:25.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eUnder Abies religiosa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe larger one is about 6 inches across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe context is light yellow, and occasionally reddish for about 1 mm near the cuticle.
