mushroom with two stems. I always had the feeling that mushrooms could do this, and the same with the mycelial organism. that if two organisms met and fell in love that they could fuse into one organism. Now my understanding is that this is how in fact mushrooms have sex. two mycelial strands will meet and where they cross a hyphal knot appears and grows into a fruiting body:the mushroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom looking at so many scarlet waxy caps im getting the impression that these mushrooms are not fusing together, however romantic it is to think that, it seems impossible since i cant think of anything else in nature that does this.
