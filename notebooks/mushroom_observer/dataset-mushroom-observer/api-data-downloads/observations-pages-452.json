Even though someone had voted for Lycoperdon Perlatum, there were a few characteristics that fit more with Morganella Pyriformis. First, Morganella Pyriformis has a measurement range starting at 1.5 cm, but Lycoperdon has a measurement starting at 2.5 cm. From the photo, one can see that my species is closer to 1.5 cm. Second, Lycoperdon is shaped like an inverted pear, whereas my species is more or less round, which more accurately fits the description for Morganella Pyriformis. Finally, Morganella pyriformis is seasonally from spring through fall, whereas Lycooperdon marginatum is seasonally summer and fall. I saw mine during early spring. These three factors led me to believe my species is Morganella Pyrifrormis rather than Lycoperdon marginatum. \u003cbr /\u003e\nSubstrate: hardwood\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":90063,"consensus_id":5026,"consensus_name":"Morganella pyriformis","location_id":22480,"location_name":"Muir Woods, UW-Madison Lakeshore Nature Preserve, Madison, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":1455970},{"id":490737,"type":"observation","date":"2022-04-21","latitude":"43.0769","longitude":"-89.4033","altitude":276,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.19447,"created_at":"2022-04-26T19:55:22.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T19:55:29.000Z","number_of_views":46,"last_viewed":"2024-04-09T18:35:58.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eLycoperdon pyriforme was found growing on deadwood of a fallen over hardwood tree.

I then went to number 6 and chose the one that said Sporangia yellow to yellowish brown because it was not red, maroon, or red-brown. Number 8 in the key, I chose peridiucm persisting as fairly conspicuous because the \u0026#8220;wall of the goblet\u0026#8221; was obvious and persistent. Because it was Sporangia typically scattered to getregarious; stalk well-developed; peridium persisting as a relatively shallow but conspicuous  calyculus determined that it was a Hemitrichia calyculata. I checked the picture in the book and it showed the picture which matched my slide. It looked the same as the capillitium. It also had the branching which is shown in one of my. pictures.
