This appears to be a false truffle resembling the Mushrooms Demystified description of Hymenogaster sublilacinus which indicates that it is common in the Sierra Nevada, found with conifers, specifically lodgepole pine, which was the primary tree in this location. This specimen was 3.8 cm in diameter. No microscopy has been done, but the material is available.  The odor and flavor are both reminiscent of the odor and flavor of raw Boletus edulils.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2163,"consensus_id":31239,"consensus_name":"Rhizopogon subcaerulescens group","location_id":5977,"location_name":"Echo Summit, El Dorado Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":254589},{"id":107011,"type":"observation","date":"2012-08-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.80436,"created_at":"2012-08-26T09:12:30.000Z","updated_at":"2012-08-27T07:17:40.000Z","number_of_views":45,"last_viewed":"2023-10-28T17:02:16.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eUnder mixed hardwood trees\u003cbr /\u003e\nFlesh white, immutable\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4054,"consensus_id":5383,"consensus_name":"Lepiota aspera","location_id":5978,"location_name":"Durbuy, Belgium","primary_image_id":254595},{"id":107014,"type":"observation","date":"2012-08-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70747,"created_at":"2012-08-26T11:41:07.000Z","updated_at":"2012-08-26T11:44:57.000Z","number_of_views":73,"last_viewed":"2024-03-30T10:33:54.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lasallia+hispanica\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eLasallia hispanica\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is a species with a very limited distribution, being only reported from the countries of the southwestern Mediterranean: Portugal, Spain and Italy, and can only be found at high elevations (this specimen was observed at about 1300 m).
