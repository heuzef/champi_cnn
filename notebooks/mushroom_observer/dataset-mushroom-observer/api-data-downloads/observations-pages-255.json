It is quite inconspicuous, not really a common plant, but also not a rare one in Slovenia. These pictures show it after its small, whitish flowers have already vanished, and only five-chambered seed capsules with the remnants of long pistils remained. Its evergreen habit makes it most conspicuous in winter (if not covered by snow). It is considered threatened species and already extirpated from several states in USA. Orthilia secunda is an ectomycorrhizal plant (one in a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant). It is associated among other fungi also with several Tricholomas. Both the genus and species name Orthilia and secunda refer to the strictly one-sided arrangement of its flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaxonomical history of Orthilia secunda is truly \u0026#8216;picturesque\u0026#8217;. Initially Orthilia secunda together with similar Pyrola species belonged to family Pyrolaceae. The plants were separated from families Monotropaceae and Ericaceae. Later DNA sequencing indicated that Pyrolaceae and Monotropaceae form a single family, in spite of the fact that, from far, they look quite differently and that Pyrolaceae are green and have chlorophyll, while Monotropaceae are parasites without chlorophyll. Today both belong to family Ericaceae and form sub-family Monotropoideae within it. In addition, former genus Pyrola is now divided into three genera: Pyrola, Moneses and Orthilia. There is only one species \u0026#8211; Orthilia secunda \u0026#8211; present in the genus Orthilia that means it is a monotypic genus.

Since the observed ambiguity profiles for positions 422 and 443 are unique, not a single haplotype variant is shared by all collections.  For example, the single haplotype of 243052 is present only in 206608, 212358 and 288090.  Furthermore, since 288090 has the largest number of ambiguous characters, it features the majority of all the haplotypic combos found in the other 5 collections.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e \u003cins\u003eDiscussion\u003c/ins\u003e: This collection represents one of dominant forms of the existing phenotypic variants (morphotypes) of the most common and widespread hardwood-associated red-pored bolete species found in eastern North America. \u003cbr /\u003e\n The extreme morphological variability observed in this phylogenetic species can be readily appreciated from the images of the other 5 sequenced collections.\u003cbr /\u003e\nFor further information on this taxon, such as phylogenetic trees and the proposed distribution range, see the notes in \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/206608\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 206608\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1539,"consensus_id":110878,"consensus_name":"Neoboletus chamaeleon","location_id":22768,"location_name":"Somerset Co., New Jersey, USA","primary_image_id":777107},{"id":288091,"type":"observation","date":"2017-08-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69161,"created_at":"2017-08-24T21:39:40.000Z","updated_at":"2018-07-24T00:15:38.000Z","number_of_views":37,"last_viewed":"2022-11-22T06:31:35.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003ecollected for RET\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6898,"consensus_id":23898,"consensus_name":"Amanita canescens","location_id":4057,"location_name":"Umstead State Park, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","primary_image_id":777113},{"id":288092,"type":"observation","date":"2017-08-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.84964,"created_at":"2017-08-24T21:44:17.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T14:11:19.000Z","number_of_views":100,"last_viewed":"2024-04-18T10:53:59.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eHabitat: scattered under Abies balsamea, Picea rubens\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1980,"consensus_id":2041,"consensus_name":"Cortinarius violaceus","location_id":15982,"location_name":"Oliverian Brook Trail, White Mountain National Forest, New Hampshire, USA","primary_image_id":777115},{"id":288093,"type":"observation","date":"2017-08-24","latitude":"3.4188","longitude":"-76.6014","altitude":1659,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.860523,"created_at":"2017-08-24T21:55:51.000Z","updated_at":"2017-08-24T21:55:56.000Z","number_of_views":17,"last_viewed":"2022-09-18T00:03:28.000Z","owner_id":5796,"consensus_id":31030,"consensus_name":"Polyporales","location_id":9318,"location_name":"Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia","primary_image_id":777112},{"id":288094,"type":"observation","date":"2017-08-24","latitude":"3.4188","longitude":"-76.6014","altitude":1659,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69597,"created_at":"2017-08-24T21:57:57.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T04:19:25.000Z","number_of_views":41,"last_viewed":"2024-04-06T21:58:55.000Z","owner_id":5796,"consensus_id":18394,"consensus_name":"Agaricomycetes","location_id":9318,"location_name":"Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia","primary_image_id":777118},{"id":288095,"type":"observation","date":"2017-08-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.17274,"created_at":"2017-08-24T22:02:58.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T13:34:26.000Z","number_of_views":42,"last_viewed":"2023-07-04T17:58:14.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eApproximately 2 inches tall.
