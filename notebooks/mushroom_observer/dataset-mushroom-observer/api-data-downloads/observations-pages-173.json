So perhaps the microclimate under the fallen tree for 2.5 yrs got it started.  The mushroom was uphill \u0026amp; 15-20ft from the base of the (dead) tree.  So it\u0026#8217;s not an obvious association with the grand fir.  The nearest pine is 300ft away, and there is a large douglas fir tree between the mushroom and that pine, So no pine association.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter realizing how uncommon this is, I went back to retrieve the sample to dry, but it was gone.  However I found another partially dried sample (it\u0026#8217;s been sunny) lying uprooted on the ground in the same location (definitely not original sample, as it is not broken), but with all gills stripped as if some small creature ate all the gills away.

Looking to the species given in the ref., there is just one species with similar spore dimensions: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Melaspilea+diplasiospora\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eMelaspilea diplasiospora\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which is said to be found parasitizing \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Graphis+elegans\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eGraphis elegans\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, but here that is not the case, since it developed alone, directly on the bark, though sharing the habitat with other lichens, namely \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_glossary_term/Graphis+spp.\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eGraphis spp.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2250,"consensus_id":47512,"consensus_name":"Melaspilea diplasiospora","location_id":939,"location_name":"Sintra, Portugal","primary_image_id":509328},{"id":199685,"type":"observation","date":"2014-04-08","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.58374,"created_at":"2015-02-24T23:34:45.000Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T23:34:54.000Z","number_of_views":162,"last_viewed":"2024-03-05T09:52:59.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eLately I have been involved in the observation of lichens with lirellas, more specifically of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Graphidaceae\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eGraphidaceae\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e family.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis is an old passion renewed a few months ago where I was confronted several times in the field with specimens that did not fit in the existing descriptions. Later (May 1st, 2014) came to observe a mythical species in that family of lichens: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Glyphis+cicatricosa\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eGlyphis cicatricosa\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Along with it and in the trees nearby other lirellate lichens developed with distinct lirellas from those of known species. It was the tip of the iceberg, that did rekindle my fondness for these lichens and led me to make specific field trips to observe them. As an example I mention that only in two field trips observed over 50 specimens of the genus Graphis. Of course, not all are of different species and it is also clear most of them should belong to the species mentioned as existing here, but \u0026#8230;.\u003cbr /\u003e\nFollowing this interest, I had access to the reference work of the genus Graphis (see Ref. 1) dedicated to a world  key for Graphis and an article where the main features relevant for classification are described and analysed (see Ref. 2). Reading these references completely changed my way of seeing this kind of lichens and started to do a review of previous observations (that I will make here at MO in the near future).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make use of this observation as a model to examplify the use of the key applied to a species that \u0026#8220;everyone\u0026#8221; refers to exist here: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Graphis+elegans\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eGraphis elegans\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr /\u003e\nFollowing Ref. 2: \u0026#8220;In the sense of Staiger (2002), Graphis is defined as having lirellate ascomata with well-developed, usually convergent labia and mostly closed disc, partly to fully carbonized excipulum, mostly non-inspersed hymenium, hyaline, transversely septate to muriform amyloid ascospores that react I+ violet-blue, and a usually corticate, mostly white-grey thallus\u0026#8221;. \u003cbr /\u003e\nThe key in Ref. 1 is organized in 20 groups, which depend on the following features: 1) Pigmentation (of the ascomata or of the hymenium), 2) Striation or not of lirellas, 3) Level of exciple carnonization, 4) Inspersion or not of hymenium, 5) Ascospores transversaly septate or muriform. Before the key the so-called \u0026#8220;morphs\u0026#8221; are introduced, corresponding to some special arrangement of the morphological features, and that are transversal to the organization of groups. At the group level other features are needed : like chemistry, size of the ascospores and their septation, and others. \u003cbr /\u003e\nFor the case of this specimens, they belongs to Group 15 characterized as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroup 15: Labia striate, excipulum laterally carbonized, hymenium clear, ascospores transversely septate\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttached you can find a photo (labelled \u0026#8220;Group 15:\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221;) with all the details necessary to reach this conclusion.

It is still difficult for me to separate labia entire vs. striate, but looking to the photos of the specimens and to the microscopic sections I found no trace of striation, thus classified it as \u0026#8220;labia entire\u0026#8221;. Regarding the carbonization of the exciple, another dificult task in general, it is clear from the photos that no carbonization exists in the basal part of the excipulum. That \u003cbr /\u003e\nthere are no lateral carbonization is less obvious, but again the close up of a section in attached photos shows that the lateral carbonization, if existent, is rudimentar. In the graphis sensu lato that I have analise till now this \u0026#8220;hymenium clear\u0026#8221; is more or less obvious, though in specimens like this it is difficult to visualise an entire ascum in the microscopy.

This location and grounds have been recorded and possible excavations may be in order for further anthropological and historically significant native history to be revealed. Interesting that Alaskan and far northern coastal tribes traded so far inland across the state of Washington, Idaho, Oregon and even Montana/Colorado, I hypothesize.  Note: Haida shaman, chiefs and war leaders all wore tall, cone shaped hats with multiple \u0026#8220;shelves\u0026#8221; that strikingly resemble Laraicifomes officinalis.  It is also notable that nearly all carvings, totems and later native art from regions east of these locations(inland and otherwise) were copies of the original Agarikon headstones from these remote regions.  Agarikon were used for a lifetime and were passed on and traded to those worthy of handling it\u0026#8217;s reflective energies. Once submitted the shamen who has given over to the mouth of the dead was said to be immortal. I hypothesize that most all native totems and carvings are all inspired by these original(Ojibwe) mushrooms headstones. Laricifomes officinalis takes multiple lifetimes to form in some cases and even now are very hard to curate, much less carve, maintain and pass on to future generations. Wood lasts much longer and can preserve color/stain much longer. I believe that from these original thinkers and spiritual physicians(Haida, Tlingit) all Native American tribes of the PNW were inspired to imitate and hope for that same power from the effigies painted upon them, only using what was available. Wood, bone, cactus, etc.  We now know, and as my current government approved patent will prove, that certain Laricifomes officinalis can and will cure every human pathogen on our planet\u0026#8230; Given the right synthesis methods. These synthesized strains I possess and am cloning are currently being reviewed by multiple corporations for said synthesis and of the 11 slants inoculated all are surviving and thriving even when introduced to household bread mold, aspergilus niger and penicillium. All are overrun by pure, white Agarikon mycelium currently at room temp in sterile PDA. My 115 page thesis is being finalized to be published later in June 2015.
