Contrary, Lepiota oreadiformis is rare. Statistically the first option seems therefore more probable. However, the sporocarps found were significantly smaller than of typical Lepiota clypeolaria, mature specimens lacked distinct annulus, and habitat of this find doesn\u0026#8217;t seem compatible with Lepiota clypeolaria at all (it grows in woods). Therefore it seems that Lepiota oreadiformis is a better fit. Typical habitat of this species are open places on dry, extensively used, not fertilized, base rich grassland, which perfectly fits to this find. With respect to pilei surface quite large differences can be found on pictures in the literature. Frequently pictures show pilei with smoother surface. However, authors state: pilei covered by \u0026#8216;distant, granular squamules, radially wrinkled\u0026#8217; (Ref.:1), \u0026#8216;lightly covered by small, ocher brown, radially fibrous squamules\u0026#8217; (Ref.4) and \u0026#8216;minutely felty when young, but breaking up into scales on ageing\u0026#8217; (Ref.:2). Also, most pictures show pilei with less prominent buckle. So, I am not completely sure the determination is correct. Growing scattered and in small groups; about ten pilei present; pilei diameter 3 \u0026#8211; 4 (5) cm, stipe 4 \u0026#8211; 6 cm long and 4 \u0026#8211; 5 mm in diameter; on young pilei a faint, white, fibrous \u0026#8216;ring\u0026#8217; noticeable, mature fruitbodies with no observable ring; SP faint, whitish-beige with slight green tint, oac6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor

(sens.lat.) large measured spores point to the group Polyporus s.str. with only two members in Europe, namely Polyoprus tuberaster and Polyporus squamosus (Ref.1). Since Polyporus tuberster grows on ground from a sclerotium the only candidate from this group remains Polyporus squamoss.  However, density of pores (measured 5-6 pores/mm; typical for Polyporus squamosus 1-2/mm) apparently exclude this option. Also, pilei surface do not show even a trace of radially arranged darker squamules so typical for Polyporus squamosus. So, this option seems out. On the other hand macroscopic traits fit well to Polyporud varius. Pilei size, density of pores, pilei color (for young pilei), decurrent pores, black, short, relatively thin stipe and substratum all speak in favor of this determination. However, measured spores are way too big.  \u003cbr /\u003e\nI have no convincing explanation for this discrepancy. May be that the sporocarps found were too young to sporulate and that the spores measured belong to some other fungi in the vicinity of the find?
