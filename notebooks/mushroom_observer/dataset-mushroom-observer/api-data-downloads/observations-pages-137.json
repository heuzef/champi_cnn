It also occurs in New Caledonia, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. The habitat is most types of rainforest except the cool temperate forests.\u003cbr /\u003e\nDescription[edit]\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt is a medium sized tree, reaching 25 metres (82 ft) in height and with a trunk diameter of 50 centimetres (20 in). The trunk is usually cylindrical, though some tree bases are fluted. The bark is creamy brown, with reddish and brown markings. The bark also features raised squarish plates of bark.\u003cbr /\u003e\nLeaves are thick and glossy, 7 to 13 cm long. They are opposite, simple, not toothed, mostly oblong in shape, though at other times elliptical or oval. Identification of this species is made easier when noticing the blunt leaf point and nearly horizontal leaf veins. At the base of the leaf are two swollen glands. Leaf stalks are 8 millimetres (0.31 in) long, and somewhat channelled on the upper side.\u003cbr /\u003e\nCreamy pink flowers occur on racemes in the months of May to January. The five-petaled flower is fragrant, relatively large and attractive. Male and female flowers form on separate racemes.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe fruit matures from February to May, though occasionally at other times of the year. It is a brown roundish capsule 12 to 18 mm long. Inside are three cells, with a single mottled brown seed inside, 8 mm long, although many capsules contain no seeds. Fresh seed germinates reliably, and cuttings strike well.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":410,"consensus_id":60416,"consensus_name":"Oudemansiella sect.

and boulders, calcareous ground, relatively warm and dry place, partly protected from direct rain by tree canopies, average precipitations ~ 3.000 mm/year, average temperature 7-9 deg C, elevation 595

In any way, T. hiemalis it is a questionable species for several mycologists. Many do not separate it from Tubaria furfuracea Ref.:(2) stating that in most of distinguishing traits all intermediates exist and hence the existing differences rather represent natural variability than distinct species. Nevertheless,what is considered T. furfuracea grows in summer and what T. hiemalis in winter. Be as it may, this year, probably because we have unusually mild and wet winter, these LBMs (\u0026#8216;little brown mushrooms\u0026#8217; \u0026#8211; according to Arora, Ref.:(6)) have been growing in large numbers everywhere in Fagus/Picea woods in Trenta valley during the whole February and the first part of March. Winter time and clearly cylindric \u0026#8211; capitate cheilocystidia, which should not be present in T. furfuracea according to Ref.:(3), encouraged me to decide for T. hiemalis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing scattered around; many fruit bodies present. Growing attached to rotting beechnuts (seeds as well as on their capsules), small pieces of rotten wood, but also on pure layered rotting Fagus sylvatica leaves without observable pieces of any other substrate.
