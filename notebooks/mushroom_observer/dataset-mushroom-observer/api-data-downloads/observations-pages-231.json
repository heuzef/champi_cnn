Different sources have different approaches. I am following Index Fungorum (current name Rhizopogon aestivus (former Tuber aestivum)). This disagrees with MycoBank and Ref.: 2, 6 and 7. Also, according to Ref.:2, molecular analysis showed no differences between Tuber aestivum and Tuber uncinatum. Therefore they are synonymized or T. uncinatum considered as a variety as a variety of T. aestivum. Another taxon \u0026#8211; Tuber mesentericum \u0026#8211; is very similar to Tuber aestivum. When old they are hard to separate (Ref.2). They have been synonymized or considered a Tuber aestivum variety by some authors; however molecular analysis showed that they are two different species (Ref.2).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacro and micro traits of this find correspond well to Rhizopogon aestivus = Tuber aestivum.  However, a possibility that the find is Tuber mesentericum cannot be completely excluded according to Ref.2. Although a hypogeous fungus, I found it only half-buried in forest ground humus and Fagus sylvatica leaves. I noticed it without any digging. This sometimes happens when animals dig them for food and then leave them there uneaten. Tuber aestivum is mycorrhizal with roots of several trees, almost certainly with Fagus sylvatica in this find. But when fruitbody becomes larger than about 1 cm in diameter they can thrive further also on ground as a saprophytic fungus (Ref.:1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrange blobs on the surface of the Tuber are a parasitic anamorph fungus. The fusiform conidia obviously belong to genus Fusarium (Ref.:3).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing solitary; fruitbody quite old (over-mature), 38 mm across; surface covered with black, large, 4-6 sized pyramidal warts; no cavity at the bottom seen; the pattern of white veins seen in cross-section does not correspond well to usual pattern for this species (too few and too coarse), but this can be explained by over-maturity of the fruitbody (numerous fine veins disappear with age according to Ref.: 1); smell indistinctive, not strong, which often happens with over-ripen fruitbodies (Ref.:2); taste not tested; spore mass dark brown, almost black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":43035,"consensus_name":"Rhizopogon aestivus","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":692879},{"id":262791,"type":"observation","date":"2016-11-28","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.71415,"created_at":"2016-11-29T16:04:35.000Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T21:33:01.000Z","number_of_views":75,"last_viewed":"2023-11-09T03:12:07.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing in a mostly live oak habitat.\u003cbr /\u003e\nCaps up to 6.8 cm across and dry.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSpores ~ 8.5-10.0 X 5.2-6.9 microns, ellipsoidal and moderately to coarsely verrucose.\u003cbr /\u003e\nKOH on cap was neg.\u003cbr /\u003e\nTop half looks like a Telamonia but with a submarginate bulb.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":9,"consensus_id":2006,"consensus_name":"Cortinarius regalis","location_id":121,"location_name":"Bon Tempe Reservoir, Marin Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":692893},{"id":262792,"type":"observation","date":"2016-11-27","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.919532,"created_at":"2016-11-29T17:44:35.000Z","updated_at":"2019-03-03T08:50:26.000Z","number_of_views":96,"last_viewed":"2024-02-15T06:37:37.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eSmall solitary mushroom found growing by drainage pipe outlet area.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":9758,"consensus_id":60421,"consensus_name":"Oudemansiella sect.
