The targeted amplicon was ITS1F ==\u0026gt; LR22, meaning that a full-length ITS and the first 300+ bps of LSU should have been procured as a contiguous sequence under ideal conditions, with at least some overlap between the reads.  However, due to unknown technical issues affecting a good number of samples processed late last year, many generated reads came out short/truncated.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn this case, the forward read delivered the first 443 bps of ITS (full-length ITS1 \u0026amp; 5.8S subloci and partial ITS2 sublocus) before the peaks disappeared into the noisy baseline, and the reverse read barely crossed into the 3\u0026#8217; end of ITS2 before the same thing happened.  Thus the two reads don\u0026#8217;t overlap and cannot be connected.  The two sequence fragments are posted to this obsie.\u003cbr /\u003e\nStill, despite this shortcoming, the short reads are long enough for publication in GenBank.  The ITS sequence from the forward read matches GenBank accessions of this taxon published by me in the past.  The LSU fragment is 100% identical to GB accessions of both \u003ccite\u003eP. sclerotiorum\u003c/cite\u003e and \u003ccite\u003eP. pseudoscleroriorum\u003c/cite\u003e.
