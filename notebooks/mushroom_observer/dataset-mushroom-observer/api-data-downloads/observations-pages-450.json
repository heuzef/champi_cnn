bark of branch of Pseudotsuga menziesii which extends out over the beach, about 2m above the beach\u003cbr /\u003e\nQuite surprising to me. Not feeling well that day and this was the only thing I photographed, as it looked interesting \u0026#8211; seemed to be 2 lichens with one possibly parasitic on the other. Took a fingernail sized specimen which disappointed when examined at home as it didn\u0026#8217;t include the 2nd lichen. When finally did microscopy I was surprised (and chagrined) to find it was another Sigridea californica.

on a steep east-facing slope of the east bay on which there might not be a single conifer, mostly oak and bay. smooth slightly pliable (almost brittle) shiny lacquered antlers stems and caps, pores turn brown when compressed, concentric rings of bright red growth fading to yellow-orange before the cap margin on the two larger non-antler individuals that were farther up the stump (each of whom was about a hand\u0026#8217;s width and about an inch above the ground). pores white and visible when held at half arm\u0026#8217;s length. As of yet, it is unclear if it was growing on oak or bay as the stump is very decayed. the two antlered ones were buried into the sand/clay-rich topsoil up to their pore layers peeking over a thin layer of oak/poison-oak(ahh)/bay/fern duff. I\u0026#8217;ve been reading Terry Willard\u0026#8217;s book on Reishi, and because he indicates it is quite rare to find antlers I unburied them cautiously to keep them as intact as possible and left the bigger caps up on the stump even though they were cleaner. at the time of this post they\u0026#8217;ve been in the fridge for just under a day in a paper bag in a zip-lock bag. i\u0026#8217;ll try propagating the very base of the antler stems onto wet cardboard then agar as tradd cotter recommends to avoid spreading the contaminants that might be lurking alongside their released spores. I can see some hyphal activity already even without cardboard! I\u0026#8217;ll put everything but the regenerative stem base in a food dehydrator I think.  But I\u0026#8217;m real vexed cause I cant clean the dirt off at all without chipping off the cap\u0026#8217;s outermost layer or I would make a tincture of one\u0026#8230;. could I make a tincture with with the mushroom, dirt and all if I used 151 proof? maybe after storing them dry or washing with peroxide? Could I grind one real fine as a sanitization measure after drying then make a tincture?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpdate on the 20th: I returned to the stump after yesterday\u0026#8217;s light rain to find the other two still there (I wanted to at least give them a chance to release spores into the moistened surroundings before collecting, because rain is sparse this year and has been for the last few). I collected them both, as they are cleaner than the antlers, so I felt more sure that I could safely use them to make a tincture and possibly clone on agar. I added pictures of these.\u003cbr /\u003e\nUpdate: I got cultures from the contexts and stipes on MEA. The context is dark brown in most sections except near the growth margin where it is light brown with dark brown patterns.\u003cbr /\u003e\nTwo months later: After a rare torrential late spring rain, I ran out to the stump and found Persephone (the fungus\u0026#8217; name) had produced yet another mushroom (on the weave, in the picture). I\u0026#8217;ve been taking a tincture made from those I found in March, before going to sleep, and it is dependably soporific in a heavy sort of way. I made the tincture by drying the cleaned and chopped mushrooms in a food dehydrator, after tissue transfers, then putting them in a pint mason jar with 151 proof Everclear for just over half a month (until the liquid was a bright translucent golden-yellow) then strained the mushrooms out and put them in another jar to which I added almost-boiling distilled water; I let the emersion sit for seven hours, then mixed it with the other to wind up with around 45 to 50 proof.\u003cbr /\u003e\nI grew the cultures out on agar, transferred to rye then to sterilized and pasteurized oak sawdust (which they seem to take to about equally well. I lugged a couple of freshly felled bay logs out from near where I found it, and now they\u0026#8217;re in the garden to be inoculated when the sawdust is fully colonized.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":90892,"consensus_id":264,"consensus_name":"Ganoderma lucidum","location_id":7827,"location_name":"Contra Costa Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1467093},{"id":488708,"type":"observation","date":"2021-08-01","latitude":"43.8289","longitude":"-84.8856","altitude":251,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.86725,"created_at":"2022-03-19T23:42:24.000Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T15:54:43.000Z","number_of_views":16,"last_viewed":"2024-02-04T04:50:19.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFruiting under conifer.

scattered group of around a dozen specimens growing singly or in small clusters in the sandy margin (not a bank) of an undisclosed stretch of Coopers Road (a sandy-gravel road open to vehicular traffic).  This is \u003cb\u003eCollection A\u003c/b\u003e labeled in the photos.  \u003cb\u003eCollection B\u003c/b\u003e was found in the same spot 7 days later.  The whole road is surrounded by woods on both sides.  The trees in the vicinity of the collections are pitch pines, a few arbovitae (probably \u003ccite\u003eJuniper virginiana\u003c/cite\u003e) and 3 stunted and scrawny \u003ccite\u003eBetula populifolia\u003c/cite\u003e (10-15  ft tall).  The weather in New Lisbon, NJ, was 64-70/45-50 F at the end of October and only 54-61/28-40 F in the first 6 days of November (records from www. accuweather.com).\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe morphology can be inferred from the photos, none of which, unfortunately, was taken \u003ccite\u003ein situ\u003c/cite\u003e, as I was just hiking, not mushrooming, on both occasions.  I also misplaced my notes, so the brief description below is based on the photos and memories.  The caps were brownish gray with a pinkish tinge, the gills were \u0026#8220;cinnamon-buff\u0026#8221; to \u0026#8220;pinkish-cinnamon\u0026#8221; in R. Ridgway\u0026#8217;s \u003ccite\u003eColor standards and color nomenclature\u003c/cite\u003e (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/anatomyofcolour/status/955485224804155392?lang=cs\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/...\u003c/a\u003e).  The largest cap of \u003cb\u003eCollection A\u003c/b\u003e was only 4 cm wide, while the largest cap from the November fruiting was no more than 5.5 cm wide, and the stipe lengths were at the most half the cap width.  The diminutive fruitbody size is not due to lack of precipitation, as the area had 2.5\u0026quot; of rain between Oct. 22 and Nov. 3, so I think this organism naturally produces basidiomata of a small stature.  The crushed flesh had a pronounced odor of coconut and slowly tasted slightly acrid after about 10 sec., and the latex was watery to whitish, not staining the gills.  This allowed me to successfully key this critter out to couplet 38 in Eastern Field Key Group A in Bessette\u0026#8217;s milkcap book: \u003ccite\u003eL. glyciosmus\u003c/cite\u003e, \u003ccite\u003eL. hibbardae var. hibbardae\u003c/cite\u003e and \u003ccite\u003eL. hibbardae var. glaucescens\u003c/cite\u003e.  Sequencing this collection was the next step.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eDNA sequencing results and discussion\u003c/b\u003e (posted 28-Mar-22):\u003cbr /\u003e\nA full-length consensus nrTS sequence of 637 bps long was obtained from two clean reads and posted here.  A BLASTn-100 of this sequence gave a hit list that was difficult to interpret, but accessions called \u003ccite\u003emammosus\u003c/cite\u003e and \u003ccite\u003eglyciosmus\u003c/cite\u003e were 98-100% similar to my query.  I didn\u0026#8217;t see any accessions labeled as \u0026#8220;Lactarius hibbardae\u0026#8221;.  As a matter of fact, a subsequent search of this name in GenBank came back empty-handed.  It\u0026#8217;s also noteworthy that Bessette\u0026#8217;s opus doesn\u0026#8217;t mention \u003ccite\u003eL. mammosus\u003c/cite\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\nTo make sense of the BLASTn results, I needed to vet the accession through a reliable peer-reviewed publication.  A search for \u0026#8220;Lactarius mammosus phylogeny\u0026#8221; led me to the 2016 Barge et al. publication (see the ref. in the proposal window).  While the paper deals with a number of \u003ccite\u003eLactarius\u003c/cite\u003e documented in the Rocky Mountain area, the listed ITS accessions of \u003ccite\u003eL. glyciosmus\u003c/cite\u003e and \u003ccite\u003eL. mammosus\u003c/cite\u003e from Europe are plentiful.  Based on the information in the text and the phylogenetic tree on p. 423 (posted here exclusively for educational and illustrative purposes as Fig. 1), I was able to establish that my collection is that of \u003ccite\u003eLactarius mammosus\u003c/cite\u003e: the ITS sequence is 99.67~99.84% similar to accessions AY097042, JF908316, KF133265, AJ633116, and FM992937 from Europe and 99.84~100% similar to KJ705202 \u0026amp; MN992611 from eastern Canada.  At the same time, pairwise similarity to sequences of \u003ccite\u003eLactarius glyciosmus\u003c/cite\u003e and the mysterious \u003ccite\u003eLactarius aff. glyciosmus\u003c/cite\u003e listed in the study is 98.0~98.7%.  It\u0026#8217;s clear from the paper and BLASTn hits that both \u003ccite\u003eglyciosmus\u003c/cite\u003e and \u003ccite\u003emammosus\u003c/cite\u003e are present in eastern and western North America, if one is to believe published ITS and RPB-2 data.\u003cbr /\u003e\nBarge et al. state on pp. 430-431: \u0026#8220;\u003ccite\u003eLactarius glyciosmus\u003c/cite\u003e is morphologically and phylogenetically similar to \u003ccite\u003eL. mammosus\u003c/cite\u003e; however, the latter has a browner pileus, stouter stature and more elongate, more reticulate basidiospores (Heilmann-Clausen et al. 1998). Phylogenetic placement of sequences isolated from ectomycorrhizal root tips of \u003ccite\u003ePinus sylvestris\u003c/cite\u003e L. (AJ633116, Heinonsalo et al. 2007) and Picea abies (L.) Karst. (FM992937, Kj√∏ller and Clemmensen 2009) confirm that \u003ccite\u003eL. mammosus\u003c/cite\u003e associates with members of the \u003ccite\u003ePinaceae\u003c/cite\u003e; however, it also has been reported with \u003ccite\u003eBetula\u003c/cite\u003e mainly in subalpine areas (Heilmann-Clausen et al. 1998).\u0026#8221;.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMy collection features small basidiomata, similar in size to \u003ccite\u003eL. glyciosmus\u003c/cite\u003e and \u003ccite\u003eL. nanus\u003c/cite\u003e, whereas \u003ccite\u003eL. mammosus\u003c/cite\u003e of Europe is reported to be a larger, more robust mushroom.

I\u0026#8217;m wondering if the spores found here (from a fairly substantial drop)\u0026#8230; 1. may represent some other fungus growing on the polypore; 2. the spores of Physisporinus crocatus have walls that become weak and collapse.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":62322,"consensus_name":"Physisporinus crocatus","location_id":15664,"location_name":"Susquehanna Riverlands, Salem Twp., Luzerne Co., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":1451419},{"id":489457,"type":"observation","date":"2022-03-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.86916,"created_at":"2022-04-04T09:06:47.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T09:06:52.000Z","number_of_views":29,"last_viewed":"2024-03-04T00:04:32.000Z","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":26967,"consensus_name":"Corticiaceae","location_id":15664,"location_name":"Susquehanna Riverlands, Salem Twp., Luzerne Co., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":1451427},{"id":489458,"type":"observation","date":"2022-03-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.74149,"created_at":"2022-04-04T09:24:55.000Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T13:30:26.000Z","number_of_views":41,"last_viewed":"2024-04-13T23:18:52.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eSame fruiting on same large downed beech trunk as \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/404133\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 404133\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/451114\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 451114\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":27483,"consensus_name":"Dentocorticium","location_id":15664,"location_name":"Susquehanna Riverlands, Salem Twp., Luzerne Co., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":1451434},{"id":489459,"type":"observation","date":"2022-03-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.73832,"created_at":"2022-04-04T09:42:05.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T09:42:09.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2024-03-04T00:06:18.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFresh fruiting on the underside of a large hardwood trunk (ash or tulip poplar).\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":861,"consensus_name":"Pleurotus","location_id":15664,"location_name":"Susquehanna Riverlands, Salem Twp., Luzerne Co., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":1451440},{"id":489460,"type":"observation","date":"2017-08-09","latitude":"32.4449","longitude":"-110.7889","altitude":2715,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.48164,"created_at":"2022-04-04T16:00:39.000Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T19:21:40.000Z","number_of_views":6,"last_viewed":"2024-03-10T13:46:25.000Z","owner_id":81516,"consensus_id":373,"consensus_name":"Amanita muscaria","location_id":3738,"location_name":"Mount Lemmon, Pima Co., Arizona, USA","primary_image_id":1451443},{"id":489461,"type":"observation","date":"2022-03-27","latitude":"27.9842","longitude":"-81.8584","altitude":14,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.09759,"created_at":"2022-04-04T17:05:46.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-17T21:20:42.000Z","number_of_views":21,"last_viewed":"2024-01-25T00:34:36.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn fallen oak.
