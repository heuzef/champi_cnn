Never seen any fungi parasitizing a Rhodie, much less a living one. The older fruiting bodies from last week that I noticed driving by are all but now wilted due to frost and thaw over the last few days, although they were very large (10-12 cm caps). You can still see sagging remnants of the large fruiting bodies in the images seen here (on side of the large Rhododendron trunk halfway up on both sides). I initially thought they were Gymnopilus (possibly in the “junonius group” or G. ventricosus) from a distance, but on inspecting them last week (w/o camera) I noted the gills were deep purple, without any visible veils and the “under fruiting”, caespitose caps were covered in deep, velvety purple spores, as is common with H. fasciculare. I returned today to see if I could gather any remnant of the fruiting only to find that smaller fruiting bodies were almost all frozen solid. I gathered what I could and dried them immediately on home drying racks and obtained a purple spore print on a glass slide for microscopy. These look very close to H. fasciculare, but I have never seen said species as large as a jumbo Gym, nor parasitizing a rhododendron. This is perhaps an unnamed or undescribed taxon that I am hoping will get sequenced and investigated further. Multiple fruiting bodies dried and stored in herbarium. Images of the smokey purple spore print on glass slide added in this observation. I will continue to monitor this spot and hope for a big flush for future harvest and analysis. Performing microscopy for spore and basidia analysis, in addition to lamellar trama, and may make a preliminary provisional name and description with my findings as a variant of H. capnoides, or perhaps as Hypholoma rhododendronicola nom. prov.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUPDATE ON 2/2/19:\u003cbr /\u003e\nPosting images of performed microscopy using a Celestron digital scope.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMicroscopy: Spores ellipsoid to oval-shaped, with a central to irregular germ pore on multiple spores.

Thus I inferred and monitored new fresh fruiting bodies the following season; producing from dead branches or stumps from prior cuts on the host tree(e.g. this species of Hypholoma is saprobic on dead wood pockets in the living host tree).
