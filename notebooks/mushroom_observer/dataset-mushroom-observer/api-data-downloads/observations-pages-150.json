In this light an observation above 2.000 m well above tree line in a typically alpine elevation zone is surprising. Further, all my literature claims white spore print, while the spore print of the fungi found is beige (oac858), definitely not white. In several sources the ring is considered short-lived,\u0026#8216;…very quickly vanishing and narrow\u0026#8230;\u0026#8217; (Buczacki (2012)), \u0026#8216;transient\u0026#8217;, or \u0026#8216;slight cottony\u0026#8217; (Arora (1986)), while this doesn\u0026#8217;t seem to be true for the fungi on my pictures. In addition, I haven\u0026#8217;t found mentioning clearly yellow color of the buckle in the literature available to me. Authors describe the bucke as slightly darker, darker, ocher-brown or cinnamon brown (Phillips (2006)), but not yellow. Also stipe of this find is less covered by cottony, shaggy scales than observations in the valleys. From these reasons I am not sure that the determination is correct. On the other hand I can\u0026#8217;t find a better alternative. An Alpine fungi expert would probably solve the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly two sporocarps close together were found; pileus diameter of the larger 8.5 cm, stipe 8 cm long and 1 cm in diameter, hollow, somewhat fibrous; taste mild mushroomy, slightly unpleasant; smell distinctive, lightly nitrogen(?), unpleasant;  if mycorrhizal, then with Daphne mezereum or less probably Salix retusa; SP abundant, beige, oac 858.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpores smooth.
