looking mushroom, which has neither gills nor pores but smooth spore bearing hymenium on the upper side of its \u0026#8216;hut\u0026#8217;. It is an ascomycete producing spores within elongated sacks (asci) and not on basidia. There are a few other species known looking very similarly (genus Cyathipodia), but they are rare. Without microscopy it is hard, if at all possible, to distinguish among them. Macroscyphus macropus is the most common among them in Slovenia and can be distinguished from others by its spores, which have one large centrally located oil drop and two or more smaller drops on each side. It is probably a quite common mushroom, but it is very easily overlooked since it is small, usually grows solitary and is of uniformly gray-brown color, which excellently blends with the patchwork of late autumn ground covered by half faded grasses, fallen leaves, mosses and other ground debris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing solitary. \u0026#8216;Pileus\u0026#8217; diameter 3 cm, stipe 4.5 cm tall and of 4.5 mm diameter; smell mildly on earth, taste almost none; SP abundant, whitish with ochre tint, oac850.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":2442,"consensus_name":"Helvella macropus","location_id":739,"location_name":"Zadnja Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":472919},{"id":184828,"type":"observation","date":"2014-10-21","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.6189,"created_at":"2014-10-22T15:00:08.000Z","updated_at":"2023-07-08T23:24:04.000Z","number_of_views":32,"last_viewed":"2024-01-05T18:14:10.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound fruiting in large numbers beneath a birch tree in a front yard.

What attracted me was unusual substratum Picea abies, which very rarely happens with this species. Yet, a closer look revealed this is a wrong idea. Advised to check genus Abortiporus (Slovenian fungi check list knows only Abortiporus biennis) I realized this is a more promising option. However, vivid color of the find seemed to me (and still does) a problem. Most descriptions and pictures of this species in literature show much different whitish or brownish polypore, apparently growing from ground and having very different habitus. Only after some additional reading I realized that this is an extremely variable species in every aspect and many times literally \u0026#8216;distorted\u0026#8217; in its form. Also brown-reddish sporocarps in the form of applanate pilei may occur. As to substratum most sources state broadleaved trees and mention conifers as a possible, but much less probable option. Most other checked morphologic and microscopic traits of Abortiporus biennis fit reasonable well to what I found. However, for my limited experience, the vivid color of the sporocarps remains suspicious and my determination may be wrong. Can the fact that the pilei were rather old, grew on an unusual substratum, and possibly due to some other local environmental conditions such intense color develops?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing in a group of about ten pilei; pilei applanate to slightly effused-reflexed, broadly attached; semicircular to slightly dimidiate, pliant but solid, with

found this last week (mid October) in an old growth, mixed but primarily coniferous (mainly cedar) forest in the Kootenay (S.E.) region of British Columbia, in the shade, in a mossy, moist area, next to a decaying old tree.  The mushroom measured about 8\u0026quot; across.\nThe unique characteristic about this fungus, and hence my interest, was that when I lightly touched it to remove a leaf before photographing, it released a fine cloud of white spores which disappeared in a few seconds.  It was hard to tell exactly where these originated as the fungus was very close to the ground but they must have been released from underneath.  It only did this once despite prodding and cajoling for a repeat performance.\nAs a newbie I\u0026#8217;ve only seen this occur in puffballs.  Is this common?  Can anyone comment further on the species and this characteristic?\nThanks.","owner_id":6655,"consensus_id":129,"consensus_name":"Peziza","location_id":10716,"location_name":"Poplar Creek, British Columbia, Canada","primary_image_id":474430},{"id":185687,"type":"observation","date":"2014-10-26","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.32621,"created_at":"2014-10-26T19:33:05.000Z","updated_at":"2014-10-26T20:35:29.000Z","number_of_views":33,"last_viewed":"2022-10-24T17:40:37.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing in abundance now in mixed woods among leaf litter (mostly red oak and pine).
