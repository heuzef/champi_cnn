They were emergent from a 2-3 inch thick layer of wet moss in a heavily shaded, spring-soaked location at the toe of a north-facing slope in the riparian zone of the North Fork of the Trinity River.  Thick overhead canopy of mixed Douglas Fir, pines, and big leaf maple on steep surrounding hillsides blocks out sun daily at this 3500 foot elevation location inside the Trinity Alps Wilderness.  Immediately surrounded by poison oak, whose underground runners ran next to the bulbous terminus of the mushroom stipes. Tan dorsal cap surfaces were muscilaginous and sticky, thus collecting debris, with only several fine remnants of ivory-colored veil remaining.  Most veil remnants may have been swept off as mushrooms pushed through the overlaying moss layer (see top, half-emerged cap in second photo).  The only two specimens located in the area were mature, very hydrated and quite fragile, breaking apart upon removal from substrate.  Have never encountered an Amanita species with this \u0026#8220;slippery\u0026#8221; cap appearance, so hydrated and fragile, and located in such a wet and cool environ.  Specimen caps and stipe, albeit rapidly deteriorating after removal from moss, were salvaged and dried.  Interestingly, the cap tackiness remained after excess moisture abated after relocation.  No spore print possible due to rapid deterioriation during time of transport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[admin \u0026#8211; Sat Aug 14 02:03:25 +0000 2010]: Changed location name from \u0026#8216;N.
