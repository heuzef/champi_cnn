At first, I posted a description and the photos to a Texas Facebook page for help with the identification (no comments from the group).  A few days later, someone else posted a photo of a mushroom that looked similar to mine and had used the name Trametes lactinea.  Since the new posting looked similar to my specimen, I had a clue to the genus (maybe).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis clue started a chain of research that seemed to suggest that the taxonomy within the genus Trametes was not settled.  I read some papers that mentioned that a new genus Leiotrametes was being used as of 2012 and that lactinea was now considered part of that genus.  Still I could not decide if mine was T. cubensis or L. lactinea.  I contacted a person that I found on iNaturalist who seems to be an expert in the field, and he was of the opinion that T. cubensis and L. lactinea were synonomous.
