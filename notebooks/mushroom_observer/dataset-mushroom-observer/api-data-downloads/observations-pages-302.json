Why \u0026#8220;face value\u0026#8221; similarity?  A MUSCLE alignment of the present sequence with a typical one from Europe is shown in \u003cb\u003eFig. 1\u003c/b\u003e.  There is a curious 10-character deletion in the ITS2 region of the European sequence found in a few randomly sampled GenBank accessions from Europe and it is presumed to be the defining feature of the Old World genotype.  Counting it in, the similarity drops from 98.83% to 96.85% (17 mismatching positions).\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe ITS and TEF-1 sequences of \u003ccite\u003eI. badia\u003c/cite\u003e from both sides of the Atlantic show a clear-cut phylogeographic pattern (see \u003cb\u003eFig. 2\u003c/b\u003e \u0026amp; \u003cb\u003eFig. 3\u003c/b\u003e).

The genetic distance between Group 1 sequences, MT232417 and MT382639, and Amanita sp. sp-N46 RET 319-5 MN820545 may be as low as .25-.30%. RET reviewed my alignment and made the following comment: “Hence, Group 1 may be interpreted as having only one column treated as a MAYBE difference. With more data you could build a \u003cbr /\u003e\ncase for identity; however, I think you have a very good case for two SNPs which \u003cbr /\u003e\ncould be treated as no problem for arguing for a single species.”\u003cbr /\u003e\nI plan to voucher and sequence more of these.
