Mounted in 4% KOH, then Meltzer\u0026#8217;s. Second photo (KOH) shows an inflated projection that may be an ascus (my best guess). Third photo (KOH) shows two more-or-less elliptical objects that I think may be mature spores, roughly 32-36 \u0026#215; 11-16 microns. I found a fair number of these, and shape/size variation similar to the two seen in the 3rd photo down. Fourth photo (Meltzer\u0026#8217;s) shows a cluster of globose objects that appear to exhibit a dextrinoid reaction (not sure, may just be the color of the Meltzer\u0026#8217;s). I didn\u0026#8217;t find any other such structures in subsequent microscopy, so maybe this is the substrate (wood/bark).\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":43761,"consensus_name":"Dothideomycetes","location_id":15664,"location_name":"Susquehanna Riverlands, Salem Twp., Luzerne Co., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":856788},{"id":312185,"type":"observation","date":"2018-03-17","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.72931,"created_at":"2018-03-18T16:26:46.000Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T13:38:32.000Z","number_of_views":40,"last_viewed":"2023-11-11T01:29:08.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn a beech branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpores very dark in KOH, elliptical to crescent-shaped, ~12-14 \u0026#215; 5-6.5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePigment extracted in KOH orangish to reddish-brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems to match well with H. fragiforme, although this is a European species name.

When young it parasitizes other lichens of Cladonia pyxidata group (Wirth 1995), especially Cladonia rangiformis and Cladonia pocillum (Dobson 2005). In this observation the host seems to be Cladonia pocillum. It gradually incorporates the algae of the host in its own thallus (Brodo 2001) and thus kill it. When mature it becomes free-living on mosses and ground without help of parasitism. It can grow to considerable sizes. This observation shows small, young specimens, max a few cm in diameter. Picture 3 shows a young specimen just becoming fertile, where lowest, outer squamules of the host are still alive and green. Picture 5c shows a podetium of the host thinly overgrown with Diploschistes muscorum thallus. Picture 2 shows an older specimen where no parts of the host can be seen directly, however, the shape of the thallus still resembles to some extent original shape of the Cladonia squamules.
