The only trees in this area are where a wooded area borders the lawn behind the panels. Before the panels were installed (2013) the 10-20 square yard area of sloped lawn was the primary location for multiple annual fruitings of A. rooseveltensis. After the panels were installed, this same species disappeared from the sloped lawn but then began to appear on a different part of the lawn; still about 10 yards or so from the wooded area bordering the lawn. Last year the A. rooseveltensis fruitings moved closer to where the panels are. So, it seems that the mycelium may have been initially disturbed, but has since been repopulating the area in front of the panels.\u003cbr /\u003e\nI think the primary associate for this amanita is a large shagbark hickory tree (probably 80-100 years old). But, there are several 15-25 foot tall red oaks closer to the mounted panels. These oak trees have mainly sprung up during the 21 years that I have lived here.

I thought it was some sort of Marasimius since it revived in water. It only had 6 gills and they were too small to take a piece of, so I smashed the whole thing under a cover slip.  The spores looked globose but one side seemed to be flattened and the whole spore was covered with minute spines.  After looking at the Largent book, the closest I could come to was Fayodia but that genus seems to have more than 6 gills with no short gills.  The spores measured 10-11, so pretty big.  The largest cream colored cap was 1mm across with scalloped edges.
