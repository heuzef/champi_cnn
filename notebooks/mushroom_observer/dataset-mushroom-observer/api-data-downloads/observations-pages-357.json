There were many more species of mushrooms out today, and out of my collection, there are a few I worry may be something else. Several specimens (the bottom right four small mushrooms in a row in the group photo) have clear nipples and gelatinous pellicles. Others had less or almost no nipple, and I could not be sure if there is a pellicle as they were drier. Additionally, I found two immature mushrooms that did not have any veil or partial veil, which I know is a common feature. All stems are shreddable and pliable.

The species is traditionally known under its name Caloplaca ferruginea, but according to Index Fungorum its current name is Blastenia ferruginea. At first I thought the find belongs to genus Ramboldia (eventually Ramboldia russula), but spores are typically polarilocular, which is characteristic for genus Caloplaca and allied. The lichen was found on the branches of the same bush as Teloschistes chrysophthalmus (L.) Th. Fr. Blastenia ferruginea seems to be a rare species. Smith et al. (2009) (Ref.:1) states that it is scarce and decreasing and has now (2009) probably disappeared from Central Europe. It is not yet listed in the Boletus Informaticus and Mycotheca of the Forestry institute of Slovenia although some records for my country are listed in Ref.6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":77173,"consensus_name":"Blastenia ferruginea","location_id":20423,"location_name":"Krk island, north Adriatic Sea, Kvarner archipelago, Croatia","primary_image_id":1125164},{"id":393824,"type":"observation","date":"2019-11-23","latitude":"31.7972","longitude":"-84.6218","altitude":114,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.67221,"created_at":"2019-11-23T17:48:39.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T17:48:42.000Z","number_of_views":25,"last_viewed":"2023-11-10T03:35:37.000Z","owner_id":23197,"consensus_id":445,"consensus_name":"Panaeolus antillarum","location_id":21603,"location_name":"Shellman, Georgia, USA","primary_image_id":1125173},{"id":393825,"type":"observation","date":"2019-11-23","latitude":"31.8063","longitude":"-84.6034","altitude":133,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.67235,"created_at":"2019-11-23T17:52:14.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T17:52:17.000Z","number_of_views":14,"last_viewed":"2023-11-16T05:57:39.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eSurrounded by oaks\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":23197,"consensus_id":815,"consensus_name":"Lactarius","location_id":21603,"location_name":"Shellman, Georgia, USA","primary_image_id":1125180},{"id":393826,"type":"observation","date":"2019-11-23","latitude":"31.8062","longitude":"-84.6033","altitude":132,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.50867,"created_at":"2019-11-23T17:59:25.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-24T01:14:03.000Z","number_of_views":17,"last_viewed":"2023-11-21T11:53:42.000Z","owner_id":23197,"consensus_id":119,"consensus_name":"Phyllotopsis nidulans","location_id":21603,"location_name":"Shellman, Georgia, USA","primary_image_id":1125187},{"id":393827,"type":"observation","date":"2019-11-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.98885,"created_at":"2019-11-23T18:50:46.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-24T01:13:48.000Z","number_of_views":44,"last_viewed":"2021-10-08T18:22:04.000Z","owner_id":13325,"consensus_id":271,"consensus_name":"Flammulina velutipes","location_id":11794,"location_name":"Clarksville, Maryland, USA","primary_image_id":1125195},{"id":393828,"type":"observation","date":"2019-11-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.811076,"created_at":"2019-11-23T18:52:45.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T18:52:48.000Z","number_of_views":13,"last_viewed":"2023-11-25T19:20:22.000Z","owner_id":13571,"consensus_id":5529,"consensus_name":"Turbinellus floccosus","location_id":5747,"location_name":"Cuajimoloyas, Oaxaca, Mexico","primary_image_id":1125194},{"id":393829,"type":"observation","date":"2019-11-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.9548,"created_at":"2019-11-23T18:55:05.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-24T01:10:04.000Z","number_of_views":14,"last_viewed":"2021-10-08T18:22:19.000Z","owner_id":13571,"consensus_id":479,"consensus_name":"Cantharellus","location_id":5747,"location_name":"Cuajimoloyas, Oaxaca, Mexico","primary_image_id":1125201},{"id":393830,"type":"observation","date":"2019-11-05","latitude":"17.1245","longitude":"-96.4526","altitude":3177,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70619,"created_at":"2019-11-23T18:57:33.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-24T01:13:34.000Z","number_of_views":20,"last_viewed":"2023-09-06T00:38:20.000Z","owner_id":13571,"consensus_id":59414,"consensus_name":"Tricholoma imbricatum","location_id":5747,"location_name":"Cuajimoloyas, Oaxaca, Mexico","primary_image_id":1125204},{"id":393831,"type":"observation","date":"2019-11-05","latitude":"17.1339","longitude":"-96.4565","altitude":3124,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70619,"created_at":"2019-11-23T19:14:07.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-24T01:12:49.000Z","number_of_views":19,"last_viewed":"2023-09-08T12:05:18.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMy new friend from Cuajimoloyas was really excited about this mushroom and I could not determine why.
