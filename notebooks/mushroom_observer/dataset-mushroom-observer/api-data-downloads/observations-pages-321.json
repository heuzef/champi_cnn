All observed traits do not fit well to any Peziza species description I was able to find. The best fit seems to be Peziza varia group (Ref.1). The fruit body shows (considered typical) five distinct layers in cross section. Asci and paraphyses fit dimensionally well to Peziza varia, however, paraphyses\u0026#8217; shape is not moniliform as described in most sources including Breitenbach (Ref. 6). The habit seems only marginally similar to pictures found in the literature (with eventual exception in Ref. 9). Measured spores are consistently too narrow. They exhibit two distinct oil drops when still in asci (observed slightly out of microscope focus). This contradicts to most descriptions in the literature, an exception being Ref.: 5. Also Ref.: 6 states that with several Peziza species oil drops disappear, when the spores become mature and are released from asci. Substratum is very strange. It should be wood/roots according to most sources, but there was no wood or roots of reasonable size in the vicinity of this fruit body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlternativelyy Peziza cerea (Sowerby) Gilled, also belonging to this group, was consider. Hohmeyer\u0026#8217;s key in Ref. 8 seems conform to this determination. Peziza cerea has slightly narrower spores than Peziza varia, hence it somewhat better, but not fully, fits to this find. It doesn\u0026#8217;t have moniliform paraphyses. Also: Ref. 3. states as (one of possible) substratum small wood debris and Ref. 6. states (among other options) organic debris. Both could eventually be present under the moss layer where the fruit body was growing. But, for Peziza cerea the edge of the fruit body should be entire according to Medardi Ref.: 3., which is not the case in this find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, the upper thoughts may be already superfluous. Molecular research (Ref.: 2) in 2002 apparently demonstrated no justification for recognizing more than one species in the Peziza varia complex. The study included 27 specimens that have been referred to under the names Peziza cerea, Peziza micropus and Peziza repanda from an array of substrates. Morphological characters used to delimit species within this complex, such as color variation of the apothecia, presence or absence of a stipe, stratified or non-stratified medullary exciple and its layers, and moniliform vs. filiform paraphyses were not correlated with the subgroups supported by ITS analyses and appeared to be plastic. Therefore, Peziza cerea, Peziza repanda and Peziza micropus are placed in synonymy with Peziza varia. I don\u0026#8217;t know to what degree these results are generally accepted today. But they do not reflect (yet?) in Index Fungorum and MycoBank. If this research is accepted, then this find could be named Peziza varia (Hedw.: Fr.)
