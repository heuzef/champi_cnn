I have attempted to use the National Audubon Guidr as well as Gary Lincoffs the complete mushroom hunter with no luck on ID.  I would love some feedback if I missed something in these guides.  It is roughly palm sized cap with furled edges and white or brown powdery layer on most caps.  It’s gills are attached and it does have a ring. I’m not sure if the ring qualifies as a veil.  It has a woody pleasant odor.  The gills are a yellowish Brown. The cap has small specks that are whitish almost like the top of whole wheat bread.  When cut the flesh is white.  It feels moist and dampens the paper when placed on it for spore print. The spore print is white.  The stalk is tough and fibrous.  It appears that the gills continue down the stalk.
