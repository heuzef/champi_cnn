Red with a lighter band along the pileal margin under the tube layer; slow blueing after removal of the tubes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpore colour: olivaceous\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStipe: 90 \u0026#215; 25 (37)mm (max. 180mm); central; club-shaped, irregular, often slightly bent; covered with more or less visible reticulum, especially at the apex fine-grained, at 1/4-1/3 coarser, from middle downwards often merely as longitudinal ribs; some specimens only had fine-grained reticulation at the apex, but a smooth stipe further down; reticulum concolourous with background or red like the pores (Beeckman, 2015); this particular specimen has a clear reticulum that is built up of fine dots/lines, especially at the apex, this has only become darker after picking; warm yellow stipe with concolourous to orangy red reticulum, sometimes red at the apex, further yellow, sometimes yellow at the apex with sordid red with beetred strikes (Beeckman, 2015); bruising fairly quick; remarkable are the thick rhizoids at the base of the stipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContext: First pale yellow, later white with yellowish tinge; changes to blue rapidly after cross-section, indigo in the pileal context, especially directly above the tubes, from the apex towards the stipe and in the stipe more of a greenish blueing; after one hour the blue almost gone, weakened, duller; alas, the base of the stipe was attacked by a secundary fungus, hence the colour in the base was merely brown because of the rot; very firm; pileipellis thick and clearly visible. Last years specimen: \u0026#8220;The trama is remarkably tricoloured (yellow in the pileus, vinaceous in the stipe and vinaceous with deep blue in the, near indigo, in the stipe base) and changes into a beautiful deep ink blue colour directly after cross section\u0026#8221; (Beeckman, 2015).

Apparently, there was a non-specificity problem that precluded obtaining a contiguous end-to-end read from either direction.  Hence, the present sequence is the merger of forward and reverse reads “stitched” at a problematic homopolymeric region (the \u0026#8220;deca-T\u0026#8221; motif).\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe nrITS sequence was subjected to a BLAST GB database search.  After analyzing the alignments, the unusual “deca-T” motif present in the middle of the sequence read of MO250839 (a string of 10 consecutive thymines) was identified as a problematic region, responsible for some of the observed deletions and insertions seen in the GB sequences.  Still, notwithstanding the lower GB identity scores stemming for this problem, the BLAST list of the 100 top-scoring hits was exclusively comprised of members of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Butyriboletus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eButyriboletus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.  Examination of the GB data revealed that the poly-T motif (usually 5 or 6 T\u0026#8217;s in most Butter Boletes and as many as 9 consecutive T\u0026#8217;s in \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_glossary_term/But.+pulchriceps\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut. pulchriceps\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, acccession #KT002604) appears to be a defining genetic feature seen in \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Butyriboletus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eButyriboletus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Conclusions\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eConclusions\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e: MO250839 has all the major phenotypic hallmarks of a Butter Bolete.  The nrLSU and nrITS sequencing data are also in good agreement with this proposal.  The combination of morphological traits and molecular data both indicate that MO250839 is a novel species belonging in \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Butyriboletus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eButyriboletus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.
