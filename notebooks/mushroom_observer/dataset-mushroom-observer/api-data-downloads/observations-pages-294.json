I posted this yesterday on the Facebook Boletes page and it\u0026#8217;s caused enough uproar to cross-post here.\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nI find this species everywhere and know it very well. They start with red-with-yellow stems, yellow caps, and a yellow pore layer (more on the pores later). They soon age to have less red and more yellow in the stems, with fully red caps, and red pores with a yellow ring at the edge. Soon that edge turns red too, leaving the “beauty shot” specimen seen in the field guides. In old age the pores expand, diluting the pore color to an orange shade.\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe array photos (Figures 1, 1.a, 1.b and 1.c) show both a yellow-pored baby and a red-pored youth, with their respective stipes lying next to them (and blue bullseye marks showing where the stipe was removed).\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nKnowledgeable people suggested that the \u0026#8220;yellow pores\u0026#8221; are actually a yellow membrane that covers the area as the tubes begin to grow. To answer this I went back to the same spot this morning and took some more photos showing the mushrooms growing right next to each other (Figure 2). Happily there was even an actual conjoined pair to eliminate any chance it was two different species growing together. I dismembered and photographed that pair (Figure 2.a) and sure enough, the baby has a yellow pore layer and the not-quite-a-baby is on its way to being red. I certify that the orange pores would have been crimson in a few hours, or at least by tomorrow. I don’t have that timing pegged down but I see this species hundreds of times every summer and have personally watched them progress like that.\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nBut getting back to the question\u0026#8230; am I looking at a yellow membrane on these babies or are the pores themselves yellow? [A NOTE TO BE EXTRA CLEAR: The only \u0026#8220;membrane\u0026#8221; I\u0026#8217;ve ever heard of are the things that become (or don\u0026#8217;t) a ring on the stem of Suillus, Amanitas, etc. Please educate me if there is another type of membrane to consider!]\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nTo answer this I just (a day later) cut up those separated yellow- and red-pored caps that are the array. Closeup photos were taken with my snazzy new macro lens. They do not solve the question imho.\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nMy assumption \u0026#8211; which I would prefer to dignify as a \u0026#8220;hypothesis\u0026#8221; \u0026#8211; was that the proto-tubes in specimens this young had their normal yellow but hadn\u0026#8217;t been exposed to enough oxygen to turn red. My guess would have been that leaving them out overnight would do it. That was clearly wrong. Either these tubes are missing the chemicals that oxidize red, or they are covered by something that prevents the oxygen from getting in (the hypothetical membrane). In any case, the yellow pore layer was still yellow except for a small area where it was traumatized by removing the stipe (Figure 3). The profile shows that there are literally no tubes to speak of yet. (Figure 3.a)\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe red-pored specimen (Figure 4 and 4.a) got darker overnight and shows actual tubes, but its pore layer really isn\u0026#8217;t a whole lot more dimpled than the yellow pore layer! Both specimens show the \u0026#8220;dimpling\u0026#8221; that will become pores, but neither has what you could call an \u0026#8220;open\u0026#8221; hole. \u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nDoes this differ from what\u0026#8217;s seen on \u0026#8220;normal\u0026#8221; baby boletes? My experience fails at this point All I know is that the pores on a typical baby bolete are invisibly small to the eye and slowly get bigger as the mushroom matures and the tubes lengthen. This is consistent with that \u0026#8211; but if there is a \u0026#8220;membrane\u0026#8221; I could easily be missing it.\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nAs expected, the flesh always blues quickly and profoundly. The flesh and tubes are yellow where they aren’t bruised blue. The mycelium is pale yellow. No chemical tests were performed, but I did not refrigerate anything and can do them today if people think that would still be useful.\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nI have never personally seen the red or yellow “hairs” in Peck’s original description of the base. We do see major red blotches in the flesh of the base when environmental factors or bugs have a say. \u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nDIGRESSION FOR A SECOND DEBATE: Please focus in on the non-bruised yellow area in the base of the severed array specimen (Figure 1 and 1.a). That is the exact area that often turns blood red in older specimens! I have hypothesized that the enzymes to cause blue bruising are somehow missing in that bottom part of the base, and turn red when age or environmental conditions expose that spot to oxygen. Thoughts?\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\nA FINAL QUESTION: Igor has done the testing to prove that these \u0026#8220;oak subvelutipes\u0026#8221; are a genetically distinct lookalike of the \u0026#8220;hemlock subvelutipes\u0026#8221; also found across the Northeast. So\u0026#8230; What name go on this species 20 years ago in the pre-DNA days? Would these have been “discolor” or \u0026#8220;luridiformis\u0026#8221; rather than “subvelutipes?” [FN] Those old, morphology-only boletologists weren’t exactly dumb! There had to be a reason they agreed there were so many different species. How well do the differences they observed match up to the ones in this observation?\u003cbr /\u003e\n-\u003cbr /\u003e\n[FN] NO DEBATE ON NOMENCLATURE! We all know that discolor and luridiformis are (now mostly merged) European names that would have to be changed in any event. The point is that people with huge amounts of expertise had agreed there were separate species of red-mouth boletes based on morphological differences, and assigned those names to distinguish one type of morphology from the others. I only mean to ask if the dividing lines I am addressing match up to those older dividing lines.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":7334,"consensus_id":24645,"consensus_name":"Boletus subvelutipes group","location_id":4122,"location_name":"North Park, Allegheny Co., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":909410},{"id":328057,"type":"observation","date":"2018-08-02","latitude":"45.7722","longitude":"-67.6364","altitude":179,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.830288,"created_at":"2018-08-17T20:43:35.000Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T21:01:00.000Z","number_of_views":143,"last_viewed":"2024-04-09T21:31:38.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003ebright yellow at top of stem\u003cbr /\u003e\npore colour yellow\u003cbr /\u003e\nspore print gold brown\u003cbr /\u003e\nfound with white and yellow birch often near eastern hemlock\u003cbr /\u003e\nsignificant bloom occurred after rainfall \u0026#8211; found commonly along trails\u003cbr /\u003e\nphotos taken after collection \u0026#8211; map marked with area collected\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":12944,"consensus_id":50813,"consensus_name":"Hemileccinum subglabripes","location_id":18472,"location_name":"York Co., New Brunswick, Canada","primary_image_id":909426},{"id":328058,"type":"observation","date":"2018-08-09","latitude":"42.3683","longitude":"-72.4349","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.66058,"created_at":"2018-08-17T20:46:13.000Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T22:40:58.000Z","number_of_views":20,"last_viewed":"2024-03-12T23:33:06.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eResembles bicolor but stipe is punctate rather than streaked with reddish tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMixed oak, birch, hemlock, red maple forest.

The gestalt suggests Lepidella to me (although the cap margin appears to lack appendiculate material, and there are grooves along the margin). Habitat suggests this may be one of the saprobic Lepidellas. The collector reports an odor not unlike Roquefort cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize this is a longshot. But, given that the occurrence of a saprobic Lepidella here in NE PA would likely be of interest, I think it\u0026#8217;s best to post the observation and see what happens. Gills look way too pale for an Agaricus, and mushroom seems too robust for Lepiota (or any of the Lepiota allies).\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":19486,"consensus_name":"Amanita sect.
