Collected on soil in pastures, in prairies, in grass-specked sand dunes, and in meadows. Found in meadows around pine and conifer forests along the coastal ranges. Considered a common lawn species, but not commonly collected in California. Lycoperdon pratense seems to prefer area where morning fog banks and morning dew are common. Among the Geographic Subdivisions of California, this species can be found in Northwestern California, and in Central Western California. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDistribution: Known from many parts of the United States, and previously reported from California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia. Also known from Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, and Sweden.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tComments: The diaphragm-forming Lycoperdon puffballs have similar features and it may be difficult to tell them apart. A good microscope with oil emersion capability at high power is necessary for identifying eucapillitium versus paracapillitium from various parts of the gleba. Lycoperdon pratense and Lycoperdon lloydianum are very similar in outward appearance, which can cause confusion and misidentification among them. Lycoperdon pratense has non-poroid eucapillitium, which is scarce to absent. Ponce de Leon (1970) argues that the eucapillitium in Lycoperdon pratense is absent, however it can be found along the periphery of the endoperidium wall in collections from California. Staining with LpCB or methylene blue chloride is helpful in this process, as well as having young to mid-mature fruitbodies that are fresh. Lycoperdon pratense has a wide and very well-developed diaphragm that can be seen earlier in development than that of other diaphragm-forming puffballs. One main distinction that sets Lycoperdon pratense apart from Lycoperdon lloydianum is the unique feature of eucapillitium growing out from the inner endoperidium walls into the gleba, whereas the eucapillitium grows strictly out from the inner diaphragm wall in L. lloydianum. Both of these grassland species have been collected together in the same habitat. However, Lycoperdon pratense is a rare species in California. Lycoperdon curtisii is smaller (under 20 mm broad), has Lycoperdon-type eucapillitium that can be found along the periphery of the inner endoperidium wall, a reduced subgleba, and smaller echinulate spores. The type for the genus Vascellum, V. depressum (Bonord.) F. Šmarda, has been accepted as a synonym of Lycoperdon pratense Pers. (Larsson 2008), and this is supported with the ITS analysis. The ML tree produced in this analysis shows Vascellum species (now in Lycoperdon) as a monophyletic clade within the Lycoperdon clade, with 92% bootstrap and 100% PP. Despite the similarities in outward appearance of Lycoperdon pratense and Lycoperdon lloydianum, the ITS sequence data suggests that these are two separate species with strong bootstrap and PP support within the Vascellum clade of Lycoperdon.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":30461,"consensus_name":"Lycoperdon pratense","location_id":4959,"location_name":"Knowland Park, Oakland, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1101672},{"id":386509,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.859212,"created_at":"2019-10-08T23:30:47.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T00:23:27.000Z","number_of_views":38,"last_viewed":"2024-01-11T15:36:51.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing on the ground in mixed woods ~ 4000ft.\u003cbr /\u003e\nGrowing adjacent to Suillus caerulescens.\u003cbr /\u003e\nCaps up to 3.9 cm across.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThin ring on upper stipe.\u003cbr /\u003e\nDid not detect a strong odor.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSpore print a reddish brown.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSpores ~ (8.1)8.9-10.0 X 5.0-5.9 microns, elongate and smooth.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":9,"consensus_id":31517,"consensus_name":"Hebeloma mesophaeum group","location_id":10846,"location_name":"Pacific Crest Trail near Siskiyou Summit, Jackson Co., Oregon, USA","primary_image_id":1101700},{"id":386510,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.46484,"created_at":"2019-10-08T23:35:28.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T23:35:31.000Z","number_of_views":16,"last_viewed":"2024-02-03T12:57:09.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eHabitat: Mixed hardwood and conifer forest\u003cbr /\u003e\nSubstrate: Russula nigricans\u003cbr /\u003e\nDescription: white convex cap curves under to spore surface which appears as  light “jelly” which later turns to black; stipe white; cap becomes covered by brown “powder” as the fungi mature\u003cbr /\u003e\nSize: caps up to 1.7 cm across; stipe 2 cm long\u003cbr /\u003e\nSpore print: unsuccessful\u003cbr /\u003e\nChlamydospores: large, round and spiney\u003cbr /\u003e\nAbundance: few\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":27265,"consensus_id":1474,"consensus_name":"Asterophora lycoperdoides","location_id":16454,"location_name":"College Woods and Durham Reservoir, University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire, USA","primary_image_id":1101667},{"id":386511,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-08","latitude":"45.8369","longitude":"-115.8916","altitude":1145,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.16097,"created_at":"2019-10-08T23:36:16.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T16:59:09.000Z","number_of_views":42,"last_viewed":"2023-11-12T21:44:39.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eIt has shape \u0026amp; appearance of a Morel.
