This is a mostly consensus sequence, as the two reads share a common overlap of 805 nucleotides.

common puffball in dense moist conifer forests, fruiting with winter rains. Growing as a solitary fruitbody to gregariously on soil under conifer duff, or among damp moss and other soil humus. Among the Geographic Subdivisions of California, this species is found in the Northwestern California, in the Cascade Range, in the Sierra Nevada, in Central Western California, and in Southwestern California. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDistribution: Known from many parts of the United States, and previously reported from Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Washington DC, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Lycoperdon molle can be distinguished by the granular and spinose exoperidium that does not leave scars on the endoperidium, and verrucose spores. Lycoperdon nigrescens is a puffball with a large sterile base, becomes dark brown to almost black, has prominent scars on the endoperidium where the spinose exoperidium has sloughed off, and verruculose spores. Lycoperdon perlatum is set apart from the others due to the exaggerated pseudostipe, spinose exoperidium that leaves prominent scars on the endoperidium, white to cream colors of the peridium layers throughout the life of the fruitbody, and echinulate spores. Lycoperdon umbrinum has a prominent pseudostipe, and a dark pigmented exoperidium that may seem glabrous to furfuraceous depending on the development of the granular and spinose ornamentation, in addition to verruculose spores. The very small spines of Lycoperdon umbrinum will fall off and leave minute scars on the endoperidium, which are much smaller than what is found on Lycoperdon nigrescens or Lycoperdon perlatum. Lycoperdon umbrinum has verrucose spores similar to Lycoperdon molle, however L. molle can grow much larger and has a much more prominent ornamentation on the exoperidium. The ITS sequence data from this study shows Lycoperdon umbrinum nested with Lycoperdon vernimontanum within the Lycoperdon clade with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP support. One of the sequences of Lycoperdon umbrinum more closely related to Lycoperdon vernimontanum than it does to another sequence of its same species.

Found growing on soil or in dry duff, solitarily or in small gregarious groups. Mostly fruiting in the spring, with spring rain, among oak woodland. Among the Geographic Subdivisions of California, this species can be found in Northwestern California, and in Central Western California. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDistribution: Known from many parts of the United States, and previously reported from California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Montana, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Virginia. Also known from Austria, Canada, Germany, Iceland, India, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr /\u003e\nComments: Lycoperdon utriforme has many features in common with Lycoperdon lloydianum and Lycoperdon pratense. All three of these species have minute furfuraceous and granulose ornamentation on the exoperidium and a prominent diaphragm. However, Lycoperdon utriforme will get about four times larger in overall size than the other two diaphragm-forming meadow puffballs. Lycoperdon utriforme has Calvatia-type eucapillitium, which is fragile and forms slit-like pits along the hyphal walls as the threads dry up and break apart with maturation. The nature of slits was also observed and discussed by Lang (1993), being a factor of fragile eucapillitium. \u003cbr /\u003e\nKreisel (1989) transferred Lycoperdon utriforme into Handkea, and attempted to split it into three separate varieties based on smooth spores and exoperidium characters; Handkea utriformis var. hungarica (Hollós) Kreisel, Handkea utriformis var. utriformis (Bull.) Kreisel, and Handkea utriformis var. gruberi (A.H. Smith) Kreisel. However, as with most work done using only light microscopy, the reliability of this work is questionable based on the maturity of the fruitbodies that were examined to make these determinations. Under scanning electron microscopy, it is clear that most puffball spores begin relatively smooth, and as they swell and expand their ornamentation becomes apparent. Such is the case with Lycoperdon utriforme; most fruitbodies will exhibit relatively smooth spores until they are mature. Martin (1997) concludes that there is not sufficient evidence to have more than one variety of L. utriforme. \u003cbr /\u003e\nHistorically, due to the size and shape of this puffball, it has been recognized in the genera Calvatia, Bovista, and Utraria. Recent molecular studies (Bates 2004, Larsson \u0026amp; Jeppson 2008) show that Handkea utriformis is placed within the Lycoperdon clade. Bates (2004) showed that H. utriformis was basal to the Lycoperdon clade in a strict consensus maximum-parsimony analysis. This evidence was supported when Larsson and Jeppson (2008) showed H. utriformis being basal to all Lycoperdon in a strict consensus tree, and L. utriforme being basal to the Utraria clade in a 50% majority rule consensus tree. Because of these results, this puffball was accepted in Lycoperdon as Lycoperdon utriforme (Larsson and Jeppson 2008, 2009). In the analysis of puffballs from California, supports most of these claims. The ML tree here shows Lycoperdon utriforme as a group within the Lycoperdon clade with 82% bootstrap and less than 70% PP, but not basal to it. This ML tree also shows Lycoperdon utriforme sister to Calbovista subsculpta, forming a small group with 93% bootstrap and 100% PP support. This suggests that multi loci gene analysis will be necessary to further clarify the taxonomic position of Lycoperdon utriforme and Calbovista subsculpta within the Lycoperdaceae.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":25007,"consensus_name":"Lycoperdon utriforme","location_id":11004,"location_name":"Old Cañada Rd., San Francisco Watershed, California, USA","primary_image_id":1114237},{"id":390662,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-27","latitude":"3.4189","longitude":"-76.6017","altitude":1671,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.924699,"created_at":"2019-10-30T21:57:38.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T15:01:55.000Z","number_of_views":20,"last_viewed":"2024-01-12T07:37:08.000Z","owner_id":5796,"consensus_id":61037,"consensus_name":"Xylariaceae","location_id":11205,"location_name":"Vereda El Faro, Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia","primary_image_id":1114239},{"id":390663,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-30","gps_hidden":true,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.829495,"created_at":"2019-10-30T21:58:44.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T16:12:06.000Z","number_of_views":95,"last_viewed":"2022-10-12T02:22:34.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eI think they are bluefoot psilocybe caerulipes,  but im not able to get them to bruise blue.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":32906,"consensus_id":864,"consensus_name":"Psathyrella","location_id":1875,"location_name":"Mohican State Park, Ashland Co., Ohio, USA","primary_image_id":1114240},{"id":390664,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-27","latitude":"3.4189","longitude":"-76.6017","altitude":1671,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.865995,"created_at":"2019-10-30T22:01:08.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T22:01:10.000Z","number_of_views":7,"last_viewed":"2023-09-04T14:47:32.000Z","owner_id":5796,"consensus_id":31029,"consensus_name":"Agaricales","location_id":11205,"location_name":"Vereda El Faro, Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia","primary_image_id":1114245},{"id":390665,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-30","latitude":"39.3592","longitude":"-123.6585","altitude":176,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.48754,"created_at":"2019-10-30T22:04:51.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T22:09:21.000Z","number_of_views":52,"last_viewed":"2023-02-24T18:22:38.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFor full taxonomic description:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13691\"\u003ehttps://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13691\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHabitat: Solitary to scattered, and terrestrial in leaf litter under conifers.

Sm. based on several specimens collected in: Butte Co., California; Boise Co., Idaho; Valley Co., Idaho; and Pierce Co., Washington. Smith’s name is an illegitimate homonym of Calvatia lycoperdoides Kościelny \u0026amp; Wojt. described from Europe in 1935. Kreisel (1989) transferred Smith\u0026#8217;s illegitimate name into Handkea where it was accepted as a new name Handkea lycoperdoides Kreisel. This transfer was based on the presence of slit-like pits reported by Smith (1964). Kreisel stated that he “did not examine material,” hence the species concept of Handkea lycoperdoides is questionable. The holotype specimen cited by Smith (1964) is missing. The paratype specimens reported in the prologue represent several different species, indicating that Calvatia lycoperdoides A.H. Sm. (= Handkea lycoperdoides Kreisel) represents a nomen dubium. One of the paratype specimens (MICH 7736) matches the description from California material, recognized here as the new species Lycoperdon vernimontanum. \u003cbr /\u003e\nLycoperdon vernimontanum can be confused easily for a small Calvatia. The gasterocarp dehisces in a Calvatia-like manner, has Calvatia-type eucapillitium, and exoperidium ornamentation similar to another small sierra puffball, Calvatia lloydii. However, in contrast to C. lloydii, L. vernimontanum has a very compact, almost non-existant subgleba. Bates (2009) showed in his sequence analysis that Handkea lycoperdoides was sister to Lycoperdon umbrinum, and clearly part of the Lycoperdon clade. Supporting this claim, the ITS sequence data from this study on California taxa shows Lycoperdon umbrinum nested with Lycoperdon vernimontanum within the Lycoperdon clade with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP support. One of the sequences of Lycoperdon umbrinum is more closely related to Lycoperdon vernimontanum than it is to another sequence of its same species. This suggests that additional genes should be sequenced to further clarify the taxonomic position of Lycoperdon umbrinum amongst the other taxa in the Lycoperdaceae in order to better understand the relationships of these fungi. Furthermore, four sequences of Lycoperdon vernimontanum from various regions of the Sierra Nevada form their own group within the Lycoperdon clade with 96% bootstrap and 100% PP.

It is often found growing on dung heaps, compost piles, in very tall grass, or in open fields that get fertilized on a regular basis. Often reoccurring in a perennial growing pattern, this puffball can be collected on disturbed ground where there is heavy foot traffic, and in sandy soil. Fruiting in early winter after light rain, or in spring after heavy rain, this is a common puffball in years when the conditions are correct. Occurring as caespitose clusters, in triplets or pairs, singularly, or in gregarious rings. Typically, up to one-third of the fruitbody will be rooted in the soil, but not completely subhypogeous. Sometimes breaking away from the point of attachment at maturity, the gasterocarp will roll along the ground with the wind and disperse spores, or remain attached to the soil. The original description describes its occurrence along sandy coastlines in France, so it may be possible to collect Mycenastrum corium along the coasts of California. Among these Geographic Subdivisions of California, this species is found in the Great Central Valley, rarely in the Sierra Nevada, in Central Western California, Southwestern California.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDistribution: Known only from the Western United States, and previously reported from Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Also reported from Africa, Australia, Austria, British Colombia, Canada, Hungary, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Scandinavia, South Africa, and South America: Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr /\u003e\nComments:  Mycenastrum corium once regarded as a monotypic genus (Homrich and Wright 1973), is now described as sixteen species on Index Fungorum. There is a wide range in gasterocarp shape and color of the gleba tissue, which is why there are many synonyms for Mycenastrum corium. Some have speculated that the red to orange color of the gleba in some specimens legitimized the recognition of a new subspecies, Mycenastrum corium ssp. ferrugineum (O.K. Miller 2005). The stellate splitting and hardening of the peridium layers is unique to this puffball, as well as the microscopic characters of the eucapillitium and spores. Calvatia pachyderma and Calvatia fragilis are both medium to large-sized puffballs, which might become misidentified as Mycenastrum corium when very old specimens are found. All three of these will grow in grasslands and have thick peridium layers that will slough off until only a cup-like base remains in the soil. Four sequences of Mycenastrum corium from both California and Europe form a monophyletic group outside of the Lycoperdaceae with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP support. The ITS sequence data suggests that this species is outside of the Lycoperdaceae clade, and closer related to Lepiota cristata. The next closest puffball in relation to Mycenastrum corium is Abstoma townei, (which also has pitted spores), but with quite a distance and no support. This suggests that additional genes should be sequenced to further clarify the taxonomic position of Mycenastrum corium amongst the
