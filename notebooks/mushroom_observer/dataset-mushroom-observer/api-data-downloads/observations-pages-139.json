I SUBGENUS PERTUSARIA\u0026#8221;.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn this paper I found answers for some of my previous doubts, namely about corticolous species with light coloroured thallus \u0026#8211; whitish to yellowgreen, greyish green or yellowish green \u0026#8211; with some unusual chemistry, as is the case of the specimens of this observation, producing as results of spot tests:\u003cbr /\u003e\nC+ orange, K- or K+ light yellow, KC+ yellow/orange;\u003cbr /\u003e\nand having 2 spored asci, more or less striated.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAs explained throughout the paper such characteristics are common to a complex of different taxa:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Psilocybe+dispar\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. dispar\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Psilocybe+heterochroa\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. heterochroa\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pertusaria+sp.+1\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePertusaria sp. 1\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pertusaria+sp.+2\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePertusaria sp. 2\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e,\u003cbr /\u003e\nwhere for the latter two no names are giving, in one case by considering that the difference  is not sufficient to be consider a different species from an existing one and, in the other case, by requiring further study. It must be remarked that the first of the above taxa, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pertusaria+dispar\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. dispar\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, is only known from Portugal (where it happens that I was born) and from the Balearic Islands in Spain.\u003cbr /\u003e\nI must say that I encountered a problem with the application of the key given there, which as influence for this observation: Supposing that choice 12 is in force (i.e., Thallus K+ yellow or K- and ascospores \u0026lt; 150 um), where to consider specimens with K- reaction (which I think is the case of the specimen considered here)? The alternatives in 13 are: KC+ yellow or KC+ orange (go to 14) and Thallus K+ yellow (go to 15), It cannot be in the first since in 14\u003cbr /\u003e\none has to choose between K+ yellow (plus something) and K+ pale yelow (plus something). \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn the case of the specimen of this observation, considering the note above as a typo or misprint, the key in the above cited paper leads to \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pertusaria+heterochroa\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. heterochroa\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, since the (whole) hymenium has no reaction to the application of C or K. However, another problem appear in spores measurements. I had only photos of 6 spores, but none of them, with one exception, had lenght or widht below the maximum given in paper for \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pertusaria+heterochroa\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. heterochroa\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (120 um and 45 um, respectively).

So then I thought, \u0026#8220;Disciotis.\u0026#8221; But spores for D. venosa lack oil droplets, and the spores from this collection appear to feature multiple oil droplets. Looked at some Peziza descriptions, but spores in all examples lacked oil droplets. So I read Kuo\u0026#8217;s description of D. ancilis again (Gyromitra perlata), and noted that the apiculi are best seen using a water mount. So I scraped a bit of material onto a slide and mounted in water. Managed to focus upon a spore still encapsulated inside an ascus which I believe exhibits an apiculus. Other spores inside asci also showed apiculi in the water mount, but it was difficult to obtain desirable focus.
