Growing in a small loose scattered grouping in the grass, some are singular. Small, approximately 1 inch or less, a striking deep wine coloured cap, almost looks like velvet but is smooth to touch. It is slightly umbonate in the centre. Thin flesh. Growing close by: a mountain ash stump (cut four years ago), a grape vine, mint, flowers, an old cherry tree, and two young cherry trees. Cedar hedging.  30 feet away,  stump from paper birch.  Moss areas mixed in. Gets partial sun. The   yard has east to west exposure. The spore print is a red brown. The gills are a lighter wine colour and some are decurrent. The stipe is fragile and not thick or dense. No veil visible. No volva. The smell is hard to detect. This is the second year I have seen them. I’ve added photos of another group of mushrooms growing 2 feet away and more proximal to the ash stump. The red mushrooms are right on the border of the garden bed.
