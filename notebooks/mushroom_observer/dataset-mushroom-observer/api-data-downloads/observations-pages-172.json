In my opinion this is the time of year when the dark red varnish is most striking.  By next summer these hollow, crispy conks will either fall off from the host substrate or be deep purple color and lose their varnished hue(unless they are rained on).  Do not confuse with Fomitopsis pinicola.  Fomitopsis is perennial(fruits from year to year, similar to Agarikon) and is heavy, corky and cannot be easily cut with a knife.  Fresh and winterized Ganoderma alike can be sliced thin like bread slices from a loaf and are vibrant, shellacked red.  Fomitopsis species are black and shiny, with a dense white flesh that is present year round.  Also, Fomitopsis pinicola has only a red and sometimes orange band on leading edge(hence the common name \u0026#8220;red belted\u0026#8221; polypore).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll G. oregonense found today were parasitizing Western hemlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of these specimens were over a foot around in circumference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElevation: approx. 3000ft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemp: 58.
