Careful analysis of the data allowed me to conclude that there are only two haplotypes involved (in ~2.2:1 ratio by area under the curve) and to proceed with a manual resolution of the haplotypes and the derivation of their full-length ITS sequences.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e The overall heterogeneity pattern presented by this organism is a curious one.  First, the major haplotype inserts an extra \u0026#8220;T\u0026#8221; in ITS1 (1st 1-base-shift), but then loses a \u0026#8220;G\u0026#8221; in early ITS2 (2nd 1-base-shift) relative to the minor one that has 2 \u0026quot;G\u0026quot;s in a row.  From this point on the two halotypes overlap perfectly because the chromatogram is a single set of peaks again.  Then, at the very end of ITS2, just 25 characters before the start of nrLSU region, the minor haplotype inserts an extra \u0026#8220;A\u0026#8221; (for 3 \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;\u0026#8217;s in a row).  Hence, the full-length of ITS of Hap-1 is 665 bps long and that of Hap-2 is 666 bps long.  The heterogeneity also allowed for the resolution of two ambiguous positions located in the region between the first two points of heterogeneity.  \u003cb\u003eFig. A\u003c/b\u003e shows the alignment of the two haplotypes and highlights the differences between them.  Removal of the gaps from the alignment will reproduced the pattern of peaks seen in the chromatograms.  Because of the 5 mismatching positions (including the gaps), the two haplotypes have a genetic distance of 0.75% relative to each other.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e The derived sequences are 99.55% and 98.80% similar to accession MW882071 associated with my \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/327809\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 327809\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

This  observation shows the development of more cinnabarinus specimens as they progress from their first emergence through the bark to development of the characteristic caps with their tiny orange-red pores.

However, all macro and micro traits of this find as well as substratum fit well to Stemonitis lignicola descriptions in literature. An exception may be slightly large spores. However, the observed differences in diameter are roughly of the same size as between an example shown in Ref. 3 compared to average given in Ref.: 2. Capillitium extensions (resembling warts or free ends) were found rare and small. Note that Ref: 2 doesn\u0026#8217;t mention capillitium extensions at all and talks about smooth capilitial threads, while Ref.: 5 claims presence of capillitium extensions for this species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSporocarps cylindrical, somewhat curved, about 12 mm high and 0.35-0.45 mm in diameter, stalks 2.5-3 mm long; surface capilitial net distinctive, uniform, small
