Now I lead night hikes near the preserve at the Fonda Vela Hotel. I found the mushrooms last year and for the first time, we have a large cluster of them. They don\u0026#8217;t grow in just any place. The abundance of litter on the ground and the open shady spaces create part of the proper location for them to grow. In the pictures, similar mushrooms occur but they are not the same kind \u0026#8216;cause they do not glow. The disc, the margin, the hymenophore, and the pileus all seem to glow but the stipe only seems to glow in some pictures taken at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve so I wonder if they are the same species. As the fruit part decomposes, the bioluminescence fades away but even after several days of being cut off, it will continue glowing. There are only two spots in the property where they have been found and they always grow within the same 5 square feet area. There are many insects in the litter and perhaps that\u0026#8217;s ideal for them so they grow there. The layer of litter could be from 1/2 to 2 inches thick. The colonies of mushrooms are easily destroyed by fallen branches.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSince I am no expert I would appreciate all the help we can get to try to identify these beautiful mushrooms and start learning more about all the other mushrooms we have seen, including the fungus that grows on leaves and sticks.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThanks a lot.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":7003,"consensus_id":147,"consensus_name":"Mycena","location_id":11242,"location_name":"Fonda Vela Hotel, Monteverde, Puntarenas, Costa Rica","primary_image_id":706144},{"id":197624,"type":"observation","date":"2015-01-30","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.43721,"created_at":"2015-02-01T05:27:26.000Z","updated_at":"2015-02-01T05:35:27.000Z","number_of_views":83,"last_viewed":"2023-11-06T03:54:21.000Z","owner_id":5642,"consensus_id":21254,"consensus_name":"Plicatura nivea","location_id":11241,"location_name":"Horning's Hideout, North Plains, Washington Co., Oregon, USA","primary_image_id":503069},{"id":197625,"type":"observation","date":"2015-01-27","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.38142,"created_at":"2015-02-01T05:31:28.000Z","updated_at":"2015-02-12T15:35:50.000Z","number_of_views":286,"last_viewed":"2024-04-13T16:56:22.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOriginal Herbarium Label: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Cortinarius+vernus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eCortinarius vernus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e H.

The purple color is very distinctive, and I\u0026#8217;m sure I have seen this before and not successfully identified it.  The current specimen does not seem to be mature as I could not find fertile basidia or spores, but it does have dendrohyphidia, and clamps, which are consistent with the ID.  The ITS sequence is a 95% match to P. strigososonata. This what the identification is primarily based on.  The match to the species is poor enough that it probably is something slightly different but related.
