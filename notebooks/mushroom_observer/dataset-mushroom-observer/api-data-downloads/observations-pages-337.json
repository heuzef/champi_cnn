On June 7th I came across half a dozen polypores fruiting on the stump and buried roots of a hardwood tree that had been cut down about 5-6 years ago in a residential landscape.They were obviously in a very immature stage and I didn\u0026#8217;t recognize the species at that time. I revisited the site and photographed the specimens periodically as they developed. They grew very slowly, but by July 1st I was able to photograph the pores and had a pretty good idea what the specimens were. This morning I took the final photograph and decided it was time to post this observation. These specimens have pores that are initially round and slightly angular. As they develop they become very angular, eventually taking on a labyrinth-like appearance. Mature pores measure 2-3 mm. depending on their shape. No part of the specimen bruises black even with vigorous rubbing and squeezing. Some clear, watery liquid could be squeezed from individual caps. Cap surface slightly velvety. Context very tough to slice. Following the thumbnail photo is a series of images (with dates) documenting the development of this specimen over a month\u0026#8217;s period of time, plus additional photos of various features.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6466,"consensus_id":1169,"consensus_name":"Bondarzewia berkeleyi","location_id":11122,"location_name":"West St. Louis Co., Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":1055451},{"id":372501,"type":"observation","date":"2019-07-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.72358,"created_at":"2019-07-05T19:44:29.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T05:54:20.000Z","number_of_views":44,"last_viewed":"2022-07-21T20:52:13.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn conifer, very delicate, smelled a little bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8212;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMirrored on iNaturalist as \u003ca href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/112238470\"\u003eobservation 112238470\u003c/a\u003e on April 21, 2022.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4697,"consensus_id":27819,"consensus_name":"Fibroporia radiculosa","location_id":16998,"location_name":"Haw Ridge Park, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA","primary_image_id":1055460},{"id":372502,"type":"observation","date":"2019-07-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.60075,"created_at":"2019-07-05T19:54:24.000Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T19:54:28.000Z","number_of_views":9,"last_viewed":"2023-12-07T14:02:38.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eRussula looks like.

Two ITS sequence variants were obtained from one forward and reverse reads both showing one point of heterogeneity.  One of the haplotypes inserts one extra \u0026#8220;GC\u0026#8221; unit in ITS2, so it\u0026#8217;s a 2-base frame shift pattern.  The two read are stitched together at the point of heterogeneity for a full-length joined contig.  In addition, two isolated \u0026#8220;Y\u0026#8221; ambiguities seen in ITS1 in the forward read were resolved using the scrambled reverse read.  The shorter haplotype has \u0026#8220;C\u0026#8221; at both positions, whereas the longer one has \u0026quot;T\u0026quot;s.  The face-value genetic distance of the two haplotypes is thus 0.63%.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThere are three accession in GenBank that are likely the same species \u0026#8212; OM985884 (\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/323163\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 323163\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e),  OM473836 (\u003ca href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/56783911\"\u003ehttps://www.inaturalist.org/observations/56783911\u003c/a\u003e) and ON209210 (\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/212420\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 212420\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).
