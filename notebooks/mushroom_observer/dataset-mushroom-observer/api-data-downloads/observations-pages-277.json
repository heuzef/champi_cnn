Alternative species have pointed, conical (and mostly larger) \u0026#8216;spines\u0026#8217;. The same seems true for similar species of genus Irpex.

However, their taxonomy is a problem and species determination is often difficult. No definite and generally accepted answers are known. In 1995 the genus Leccinum comprised about 36 species distinguished by their macro-characters. Ten years later, in 2005, only 14 were still recognized based on DNA analysis (Kibby 2011). It has been proven that some traditional traits, which seemed once very important (for example flesh color changes when cut) have little significance. A new genus Leccinellum was established based on characteristics of hypha in hut cuticle. Yet not all mycologists agree with this approach. Such situation reflects in the fact that in Index Fungorum (IF) current name of this observation is probably Leccinellum griseum, while MycoBank still keeps with the current name Leccinum griseum. There are several ambiguities about species names and I am not sure I handled them correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe that as it may this species doesn\u0026#8217;t look too appealing for photography, particularly not when old (as on these photos).
