A.parasiticus and A. flavus have a very similar macroscopic appearance so it is difficult to distinguish them without an oil immersion microscope lens to view the spores. The spores of A. parasiticus are more echinulated (spiny) than A. flavus. Chemotaxonomy is a more reliable way of distinguishing the two species. You run a thin layer chromatography plate to separate the toxins and then view it under a black light. A. parasiticus always makes 2 green spots indicating aflatoxins G1 \u0026amp; G2 plus two 2 blue-green spots indicating aflatoxins B1 \u0026amp; B2. Aspergillus flavus may or may not produce B1 \u0026amp; B2 spots and no G spots because approximately half of A. flavus isolates found are atoxigenic which has led to the development of a biocontrol method by USDA researcher, Peter Cotty, of finding very aggressive strains of atoxigenic A. flavus to grow in mass culture and spread over field crops with toxigenic strain problems. He has found good results from the aggressive atoxigenic strains out competing the toxigenic ones in field trials thus reducing the levels of aflatoxin contamination in the crop.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":354,"consensus_id":42865,"consensus_name":"Aspergillus parasiticus","location_id":15986,"location_name":"USDA, ARS, Western Regional Research Center, Albany, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":396362},{"id":157125,"type":"observation","date":"2013-12-30","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.853551,"created_at":"2014-01-05T01:37:29.000Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T00:23:25.000Z","number_of_views":15,"last_viewed":"2023-09-25T08:31:34.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMirrored on iNaturalist as \u003ca href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/145929749\"\u003eobservation 145929749\u003c/a\u003e on January 5, 2023.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2584,"consensus_id":5645,"consensus_name":"Lichen","location_id":5297,"location_name":"Myakka River State Park, Sarasota, Florida, USA","primary_image_id":396359},{"id":157126,"type":"observation","date":"2014-01-04","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.82704,"created_at":"2014-01-05T01:43:44.000Z","updated_at":"2014-01-05T17:02:29.000Z","number_of_views":34,"last_viewed":"2024-02-08T03:20:41.000Z","owner_id":5645,"consensus_id":2700,"consensus_name":"Irpex lacteus","location_id":812,"location_name":"Gainesville, Alachua Co., Florida, USA","primary_image_id":396361},{"id":157127,"type":"observation","date":"2007-11-30","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.55796,"created_at":"2014-01-05T02:13:57.000Z","updated_at":"2014-01-05T02:15:26.000Z","number_of_views":20,"last_viewed":"2023-10-18T03:47:27.000Z","owner_id":9,"consensus_id":216,"consensus_name":"Hypholoma fasciculare","location_id":134,"location_name":"Samuel P.

I\u0026#8217;ve found it several times. One could consider it as frequently overlooked species partly because sporocarps are really small and because they are very ephemeral. However, on other side, it usually thrives gregariously in hundreds of sporocarps, which is, because of their white color contrasting to usually darkly colored rotten wood, quite easy to observe. This interesting fungus grows in symbiosis with algae (Coccomyxa) similar to lichens. While in true lichens algae are internal to fungi body, algae associated with Multiclavula mucida grow externally to the fungus on the same substratum. Algae can be observed like a thin layer of something green spreading around fungi sporocarps. M. mucida is also a rare example of symbiosis of a basidiomycete and algae. Vast majority of lichens is an association of ascomycete with algae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing in groups of many fruit bodies; sporocarps up to 4 \u0026#8211; 7 mm high and about 0.8 mm in diameter; most sporocarps are single, but some are branched into 2(max 5, one sporocarp found) tips;  SP faint, whitish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeasured spores are definitely wider than they should be for M. mucida. They with certainty belog to this observation because they come from tiny but clear spore pint. All sources I found consistently state that spore width should not exceed 3.0 (3.2) μm. According to the key (Ref.:(4)), only three other Multiclavula species (among 13 treated) fit to the spore dimensions measured: M. fossicola, which doesn\u0026#8217;t have hypha clamps, M. coronilla, which is terrestrial and M. clara, which is not white but pale orange. Therefore measured spore width remains a secret to me.
