But, very long and narrow, septated \u0026#8216;spores\u0026#8217; and absence of fork like or longitudinally septated basidia, respectively, exclude these options. I was unable to find anything, which I could recognize as either basidia or asci. Hence I was speculating this observation could eventually be an anamorph of an ascomycete or a hyphomycete. Without experience with them I had no clue what it is.

His very brief and tentative opinion was that the pictures probably show an anamorph of a member of Nectriaceae family, eventually from genera Haematonectria or Gibberella, while the macroconidia resembles to genus Fusarium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrange blobs were growing on and through the bark in an area of about 4 \u0026#215; 1 cm; SP was barely noticeable, probably whitish, but spores under the microscope were abundant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":39956,"consensus_name":"Nectria","location_id":673,"location_name":"Bovec basin, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":479477},{"id":187718,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-04","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.67141,"created_at":"2014-11-08T14:29:22.000Z","updated_at":"2018-01-03T05:44:35.000Z","number_of_views":32,"last_viewed":"2023-11-02T18:57:13.000Z","owner_id":6712,"consensus_id":807,"consensus_name":"Hypholoma","location_id":10808,"location_name":"Lincoln Park, Port Angeles, Clallam Co., Washington, USA","primary_image_id":479490},{"id":187719,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-05","latitude":"37.8768","longitude":"122.2642","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.83382,"created_at":"2014-11-08T14:43:02.000Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T02:53:59.000Z","number_of_views":52,"last_viewed":"2023-11-19T09:17:58.000Z","owner_id":2304,"consensus_id":751,"consensus_name":"Bovista","location_id":10815,"location_name":"North side of campus, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":479494},{"id":187720,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-04","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.85275,"created_at":"2014-11-08T15:01:41.000Z","updated_at":"2014-11-08T17:10:46.000Z","number_of_views":41,"last_viewed":"2024-02-22T11:45:31.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eIn leaf litter.

Many pros agree this is almost impossible without microscopy. No wonder many old observations seem to be questionable particularly in Melanoleuca melaleuca group where in addition species names melaleuca, polioleuca and vulgaris have been treated differently by different authors. Krieglsteiner (2001) states that large part of all historical observations not supported with an available exsiccate should be simply forgotten. Nevertheless, following Ref.1.the mushrooms photographed seem to be Melanoleuca polioleuca.
