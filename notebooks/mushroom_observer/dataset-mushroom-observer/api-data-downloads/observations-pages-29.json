This mushroom is very small. It appears to be a fungus on a fungus. I\u0026#8217;m wondering if it is not parasitic, the stem is some what ridged and tough. The Sarcoseypha seems to be deteriorating from it. I tried to take the whole thing but the Sarcoseypha crumbled. I managed to save both but the two had separated by the time i got to leval ground. Both were coming from well decomposing twigs that have accumulated on top of each other on the side of the cliff. The location of this was on a north sloping cliff about 600 feet up where the snow did not accumulate very much because it is a slight overhang and because of the angle. any Ideas ? I placed the little guy across a quarter so you can see the size.

It absolutely does not have a sulphur-like or coal tar smell. In fact, it smells a bit like the green corn smell of some Inocybes. So, does anyone have any idea of what it might be? I wasn\u0026#8217;t able to get a spore print on this one but last year\u0026#8217;s model gave a white print. Oh, and the pileus is 9.5cm across, stipe at apex is 2cm, and 13cm long.

picked this up because of the distinctive color, thinking it was Amaurodon, which was collected previously on one of the Pt Reyes Mycoblitz forays, but this  specimen lacked the colorful ornamented spores and clamps that characterize Amaurodon.  After looking in Fungi of Switzerland it seemed to be close to Byssocorticium pulcharum, but the spores were too small, and B atrovirens has clamps, which this specimen does not.  A web searched turned up the name B. californicum, and the microscopic description of it fits well.  Macroscopically the color is a bit off.  Julich calls it gray-green, while this is definitely more blue-green.  The difference could be age of the specimen he examined. Interestingly the holotype comes from Mt. Vision and was found on rotted Pinus muricatus wood.  The pictured specimen is fruiting on a large rust gall.  The species was very common on the underside of dead wood all over the top of Mt.
