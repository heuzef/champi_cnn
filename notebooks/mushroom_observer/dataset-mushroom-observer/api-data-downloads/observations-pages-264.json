Hence confusion and misidentifications are frequent. Also nomenclature history of these species is \u0026#8216;difficult\u0026#8217;. From this reason some experts consider published distribution ranges of these species as questionable.

However, measured spores were much too small for it. Their dimensions and particularly narrow spores (Q exceeding 1.6) speaks in favor of Tricholoma lascivum. Also other macro traits and habitat seems to fit reasonably well to this determination. Alternatives: Tricholoma album is a symbiont with Betula or Quercus, which were not present in the vicinity; Tricholoma columbetta is practically without odor (Ref. 2 and 3) while the find had strong, unpleasant smell on gas or chemistry; Tricholoma album and Tricholoma columbetta also have somewhat smaller spores then measured, while, Tricholoma inamoenum has significantly larger

found these gorgeous mushrooms growing gregariously in the grass (near pines) in a public park in Northwest Georgia (Floyd County). Caps are extremely variable in color, ranging from golden brown to lilac to blue to green. Some of these colors are arranged in concentric zones. Gills are barely decurrent and crowded and range in color as well (peach to lilac to dirty brown). Gills (and flesh and top of stipe) turn green to blue (after an hour or so) after damage. Strands of milk cover the gill surface of some specimens. Stipes are pale lilac to peach and fairly short. Spore print is a light ochre to peach tone.( I can attach spore print and bruising photos upon request). I am thinking the closest matches are Lactarius paradoxus and Lactarius chelidonium var. chelidonioides, but I wanted to get some more eyes on this!
