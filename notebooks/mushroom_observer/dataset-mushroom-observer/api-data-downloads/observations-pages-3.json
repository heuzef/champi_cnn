Other close ones are H. subminutulus which is the same but with smaller spores, so it might be that.  H. reai which is almost the same, but with a very bitter taste.  I didn\u0026#8217;t get the taste, so it might be that.  But it is listed as very rare only found once by D. Desjardin.  H. mollis seems to be larger. more yellow, and becomes squamulose when dry.  These stay smooth.  And finally H. marchii, which has a collybioid shape and is larger.  Also H. minutulus is the only one that says probably common, but overlooked do to its small size.  It also says it is found in northern redwood forests, but since Largent is from up the Humboldt way, I will assume he means that\u0026#8217;s where he finds them\u0026#8230; in any case none of these state they are under live oak and Ca. bay, which is where I found these.

Anyway, there are different types of wood rotters, eating away at different parts of the wood.  These are heart wood rotters, which go after the cellulose in the interior dead wood at the heart of the tree.  Once the cellolose is gone, only the brown lignin is left, which loses all strength, and becomes crumbly.  But also with heart wood rotters, there are top rotters, and but rotters.  The top rotters go after the heart wodd from the top of the tree, and the but rotters go after it from the base.  These are top rotters, and the fruitings of these are only at the tops of trees.  But as they rot out the center of the tree, it weakens, and eventually breaks off in the wind.  Then you get to find infected branches lying on the forst floor, and the fruiting bodies.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":58277,"consensus_name":"Rhodofomes

I was kicking up small dirt humps among this one live oak roots, where I have found R. cyanoxantha buried (And where I did find one R. cyanoxantha near by).  But in one of the dirt humps, this small white ball popped up.  I cleaned up the hump, and found a bunch of these whitish balls.  They each have this one small \u0026#8220;root\u0026#8221;, and are kinda like a small two lobed potato.  They have a hard thick whitish skin, with an interior spore mass.  This points to the genus of Hymenogaster, with the small size and growth on live oak roots, this points to H. parksii, which was found in the notes for H. sublilacinus in Arora.  The ball seems to have this strange band across them, which I tried to show in the third photo.  The spore mass looks like a lot of squished gills radiating out from a central point on one end of the tuber, which I tried to show in the forth photo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3/1/2008 \u0026#8211; Update on this id, now using the Field guide to N.A. truffles.  This is a small field guide of hypogeous fungi, most of them not truffles at all.  It lists 90 species with photos, but a little frustrating to use.  But with the photos here these are clearly not Hymenogaster.  The off-white thick skim, and the radially wrinkled interior gets you to the genus Hysterangium.  The guide mentions a couple species of this genus, but they seem to be under pines, and most important they have a mild odor.  These were found under live oak, and were intensely odored, very funky and stong.

This observation is nice because it shows a few different stages of development. Previously, Darvin suggested Psathyrella carbonicola or pennata. There\u0026#8217;s only one image of each online, and both are from Italy. Also, both species are alleged to fruit in burn sites, which this isn\u0026#8217;t. Also, they\u0026#8217;re described and pictured as a dark brown, while mine are all pale ochre to light brown in youth. Given that they seems to occur rather frequently (at least this season) in this park, it seems an unlikely identification.

The caps are kinda purple-red when young, but then fade to a light lilac-pink in the older ones.  I even found some really old beat up whitish ones near by, but they were too beat up tell if they are the same maybe, or just some old R. cremoricolor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was abl;e to get a spore print this time, and the spores are white-white.  I\u0026#8217;ve had problem with spore prints and Russulas in the past, and there was a comment on the BAMS list from Dr. Rodham E. Tulloss that Russulas, along with Amanitas, will stop making spores if there is a change in elevation.  I gather these up near maybe 2000 ft. and take them home to my house at about 50 ft., so that might be it.  It took me quite a few tries to get a spore print for R. amoenolens, but I finally got a light yellow-creamy color spore print for that one.  So, it doesn\u0026#8217;t shut it down completely, but there is some evidence that getting a spore print with a change in elevation in Russulas in problematic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, with the acrid taste, the red fading cap, and white spore print this points to R. simillima or R. paxilloides.  Looking at the features in the discription, the only clear difference your could see it seems is the hight of the warts on the spores, one has short warts, and the other tall warts\u0026#8230;  oh, boy.  But some features which might happen are seen here, the gills fork.  I didn\u0026#8217;t see this before, but in each of these a number of gills can be seen to fork somewhere close to the margin.  This is easy to see in the third photo, and in the younger cap if you look close.  The descriptions for the two state that R. simillima rarely forks near the stipe, and R. paxilloides rarely forks near the margin.  So, I\u0026#8217;m going for it\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m really confused by what he mean rarely forks, does this mean rarely you find a \u0026#8217;shroom with some number of forking gills, or that for a given \u0026#8217;shroom you will find some small number of gills forking.  Because I saw it on each one of these \u0026#8217;shrooms that there was gills forking near the margin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther problems, he lists R. paxilloides as very acrid, and I wouldn\u0026#8217;t say that, although they are acrid.  And that lamellulae are absent, except in all of these there some small amount of lamellulae present, so I don\u0026#8217;t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, until I can measure the hight of the warts on the spores, I guess that is all I can say.

The color of these is a nice deep bright rose red, which matches the discription in Theirs, and something like R. simillima doesn\u0026#8217;t list such a color (although it does have pinkish red with salmon tones what ever that might be).  Another detail is the taste, where these are now off the scale for acrid, quickly acrid and very strong, in the oh my god get it off my tongue it burns, it burns type of acrid.  So, that matches the description of \u0026#8220;very acrid\u0026#8221; for the species.  The samples from two weeks ago had a similar color, but lighter, which can fit since the color is supposed to lighten as it grows, but the taste was less acrid.
