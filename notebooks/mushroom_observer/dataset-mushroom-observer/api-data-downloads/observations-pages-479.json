Mycoquebec gives spore dimensions for M. alcalina as having smaller widths than what I observed in all three of the 4/22/2023 Moon Lake collections seen here on MO. Also, Mycoquebec reports cheilocystidia that are narrower and without a projection. Cheilocystidia seen via the following link look much the same as I found on my Moon Lake collections \u003ca href=\"http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/mycologywebpages/Checklists/NBMushrooms/Mycena_alcalina.html\"\u003ehttp://website.nbm-mnb.ca/...\u003c/a\u003e .
