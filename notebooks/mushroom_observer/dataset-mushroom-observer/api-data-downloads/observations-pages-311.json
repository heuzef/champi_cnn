West Julian Alps, Friuli–Venezia Giulia, Italy EC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments: Laricifomes officinalis is a rare, endangered and protected species in Slovenia as well as in most of Europe. In the Slovenian fungi data base (Ref.: 6) only three occurrences are stated. However, lately more of them have become known (Ref.: 3), yet, still not much more than ten to fifteen.  The fungus is more frequent in North America and North and Far East Asia. The main reason that it almost disappeared from Europe seems intensive collection of its fruit bodies. Laricifomes officinalis is a famous medical fungus having almost miraculous healing properties, known to men for millennia. Antibiotic activities and antiviral activity of the fruiting body is scientifically proven. It is particularly respected in China and Japan. No wander, it was collected by individuals as well as commercially for pharmaceutical industry without limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts main substance is agaricin, which is nowadays produced synthetically. This released the pressure to collect it greatly at least from the commercial side. However, apart from agaricin the fungus contains several other biologically active compounds like carotenoids, sterols, unsaturated fatty acids, bioflavonoids and vitamins of B, P, E and A groups (Ref.: 5). That is probably the reason that individual collectors still endanger the species. For example, in Slovenia, after publishing some of newly found locations of the fungus in 2011 several of them have been vandalized in relatively short time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Europe Laricifomes officinalis grows exclusively on very large and old Larix decidua trees (in America also on other conifers). Such trees have become very rare. They still grow on hardly accessible places in the mountains near tree level where human impact on nature is still at minimum. Scarcity of adequate substratum additionally contributes to sharp decline of Laricifomes officinalis. Successful experiments how to artificially inoculate healthy Larix decidua trees with its mycelium and how to grow it in an artificial media are reported (Ref. 4, 5). This may eventually help in preservation of this species from extinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s surprising that Index Fungorum and MycoBank still keep Fomitopsis officinalis as a \u0026#8216;current\u0026#8217; name of this fungus in spite of several molecular studies made between 2005 and 2016, which all have proven that Laricifomes officinalis forms a separate lineage distant from Fomitopsis and represents a separate monophyletic genus (Ref.: 8).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListed in: Uredba o zavarovanih prostoživečih vrstah gliv, Uradni list RS, št. 58/2011 (Regulation of protected wild fungi, Official Gazette of Republic Slovenia, no. 58/2011), (2011).

It is easy to be recognize by its characteristic habitus. Aethalia are composed of clumps or networks of very irregular tubes. As a whole they look whitish. The species can be eventually confused by some unusually looking species from genus Fuligo. But under the microscope they can be unmistakably separated. The cortex of Fuligo species is composed of +/- rounded calcareous grains, while the cortex of Mucilago crustacea is composed of calcareous (lime) crystals, which are easy to be seen under the microscope. The find was solitary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree varieties of this species have been described in literature (Ref.: 1) \u0026#8211; Mucilago crustacea var. crustacea, Mucilago crustacea var. solida and Mucilago crustacea var. dictyospora. The last one has reticulated not warty/spiny spores and Mucilago solida has significantly smaller spores than this observation and partly much broader capillitium threads (Ref.: 1).
