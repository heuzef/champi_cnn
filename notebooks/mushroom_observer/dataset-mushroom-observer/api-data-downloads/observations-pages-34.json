It was already tilted for about 25 deg off vertical. The cap was on the trunk\u0026#8217;s lower side. The tree was eventually downed by a high water and deposited in a tilted position of about 40 deg off horizontal plane. This was in such a way that this time the pileus was situated on the upper side of the trunk and that the pores of the original pileus were directed approximately horizontally (2). New caps started to grow from the upper side of the original cap. Next high water repositioned the trunk again and deposited it in an almost horizontal position (about 10 deg off horizontal plane). Again new caps started to grow from one side of the previous caps (3). A new high water deposited the trunk on another location. Again the trunk was lying nearly horizontally on ground, but it was axially rotated for about 45 deg.

Size, almond odor, slight yellowing on abrasion of stipe and cap.  Reasons for doubt:  reported at as having gills \u0026#8220;whitish at first, becoming brown (without a pink stage)\u0026#8221;.  However, different description of gills at \u003ca href=\"http://www.mushroom-collecting.com/mushroomhorse.html\"\u003ehttp://www.mushroom-collecting.com/mushroomhorse.html\u003c/a\u003e as \u0026#8220;grayish cream in immature unopened specimens.  Shortly after the veil breaks pinkish at first, changing to brown and almost black at maturity.\u0026#8221;  [This really does seem to describe the gray portions shown in my photos, which seems to be the less mature areas.
