Several interesting features were noted at the time whilst fresh. The cap was brown, with an uneven outer perimeter.  Gills were yellow with some black markings. This Gill area also displayed some black lines in the physical appearance and I noted that after taking the images, the black areas had increased in all areas including the stipe. The stipe consisted of two colours. Near the cap was Green and towards the middle area of the stipe it became darker, and had less green. The black lines on the stipe and Gills were more visible after images were taken. It also was either wet or slimy but not sticky. There was very high humidity at the time of noting particulars. The stipe also showed a twisting pattern, and was tending to be larger in thickness towards the base but not bulbous. The fungi was found on an exposed creek bank in wet soil and in limited light.
