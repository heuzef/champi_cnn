pins start off white and after will turn red/orange, pink, or purple, and sometimes will appear blue/green. Fully mature fruiting bodies haven’t appeared purple from what I’ve seen but will sometimes have a magenta or pink tinge. Some mushrooms turn pale yellow on the outer edges of the cap and are orange or pink in appearance closer to the center. Some stay quite red in the center but get more yellow on the outer edges with magenta in between. Rarely, the cap will appear blue in the center transitioning to an orangey pink then yellow on the edges. With age the mushroom completely becomes a dull orange. Gills are yellow when young and progressively get more orange with age and eventually a rusty brown. The mushrooms will sometimes stain a vibrant blue/green color on certain parts of the cap but you cannot induce this staining by bruising the mushroom. The staining appears to occur while the mushroom encounters an obstacle while growing, such as a nail, or the roof of my shed, which I’ve seen causing this staining many times. After picking the gills will sometimes stain dark brown and will occasionally look black when dry. I’ll note that the blackening of the gills usually happens on the very bottom edge of the gills and the rest of the gills’ flesh will dry yellow/orange and are more dull in color compared to when fresh. The stipe is often white at the base which usually stains green, and the rest of the stipe can range in colors but is usually magenta/pink or orangish. Spore print is a deep rusty orange. Taste is bitter. Scent is mushroomy with a nutty, and slightly fruity fungal aroma. Dried specimens smell overwhelmingly like bread for some reason. They typically fruit downward from the roof of our old shed. The mycelium seems to favor the southern facing half of the shed for some reason.
