This is a perfect example of how different in appearance G. oregonense is from initial growth to full maturity.  by the first frosts the fruiting body will begin to decay and lose all of the thick inner pith(eventually degrading and falling off the host tree).  The entire process will begin next July with fresh fruiting bodies.  Similar woody conks that are perennial(Fomitopsis, Heterobasidion, Laricifomes, etc.) remain on the host tree year after year, season after season and add a growth ring with each season(G. oregonense is an annual species and will only be found fresh for harvest in summer and early Fall).\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2822,"consensus_id":407,"consensus_name":"Ganoderma oregonense","location_id":1484,"location_name":"Olympia, Thurston Co., Washington, USA","primary_image_id":1084796},{"id":381079,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-03","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.45349,"created_at":"2019-09-05T17:12:19.000Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T19:16:53.000Z","number_of_views":55,"last_viewed":"2024-02-03T09:34:06.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMixed oaks, beech, maple, sycamore.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":22666,"consensus_id":110427,"consensus_name":"Amanita \"sp-KY03\"","location_id":20675,"location_name":"Greenup Co., Kentucky, USA","primary_image_id":1084785},{"id":381080,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.833078,"created_at":"2019-09-05T17:13:45.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T02:34:05.000Z","number_of_views":48,"last_viewed":"2024-02-22T06:03:02.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eCollected for IGS\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6898,"consensus_id":18382,"consensus_name":"Leccinellum albellum","location_id":4057,"location_name":"Umstead State Park, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","primary_image_id":1084800},{"id":381081,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.74503,"created_at":"2019-09-05T17:35:14.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T17:35:16.000Z","number_of_views":14,"last_viewed":"2024-04-09T17:41:22.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":52155,"consensus_name":"Lactifluus subvellereus var. subdistans","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":1084824},{"id":381082,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.74513,"created_at":"2019-09-05T17:36:43.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-08T19:05:54.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2023-11-04T20:32:18.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":50751,"consensus_name":"Russula praeumbonata","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":1084826},{"id":381083,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.74503,"created_at":"2019-09-05T17:37:54.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T17:37:57.000Z","number_of_views":12,"last_viewed":"2023-08-30T00:50:32.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":2778,"consensus_name":"Lactarius subpurpureus","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":1084828},{"id":381084,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.74503,"created_at":"2019-09-05T17:39:31.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T17:39:34.000Z","number_of_views":11,"last_viewed":"2023-11-12T20:13:58.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":885,"consensus_name":"Strobilomyces","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":1084831},{"id":381085,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.61755,"created_at":"2019-09-05T17:42:06.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T17:42:09.000Z","number_of_views":14,"last_viewed":"2024-02-05T14:04:34.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":19316,"consensus_name":"Amanita velatipes","location_id":11772,"location_name":"Lynn Valley Rd. and Haldimand Rd. 70, Port Dover, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":1084833},{"id":381086,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.51071,"created_at":"2019-09-05T17:43:20.000Z","updated_at":"2022-06-07T17:52:28.000Z","number_of_views":149,"last_viewed":"2024-03-19T12:01:33.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound in a mostly hardwood Forrest.
