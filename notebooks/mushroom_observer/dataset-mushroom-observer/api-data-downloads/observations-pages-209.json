Caps were 4-5 cm, dull brown, flat (slightly uplifted near margin, sunken over the disk but with a prominent umbo which is reddish brown.  Stipe is white, 30 mm by 10 mm widening to 15 mm at base, with fine longitudinal lines. Gills white to cream, narrow, close, with some forking near the stipe, a few long lamellulae. Spore deposit sparse, probably white to light cream. Spores are 7-9 \u0026#215; 6-7 microns, warts are small, a few lines to partial reticulum. It fit Ray\u0026#8217;s description fairly well, except that Ray calls the gills \u0026#8220;subdistant\u0026#8221; and notes \u0026#8220;conspicuous longitudinal ridges\u0026#8221;.

sometimes blindness!\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis observation has a funny story. It was at this place that I found one of my first \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_glossary_term/Rinodina+spp.\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eRinodina spp.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. At the time I had doubts about its classification, but there were not many choices for a specimen with such features and the name \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Rinodina+oleae\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eRinodina oleae\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e soon came out. Thus, I planned this field trip to the place with the specific target focused on the \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Rinodina\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eRinodina\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e species known to exist there. Since it was observed on Juniperus shrubs, these made part of the target. It happens that the place of the observation has no other vegetation, except one fig tree and nothing else. Therefore, this day I went to the place and started to make my observations exactly at this fig tree and the first specimen seem was precisely the one in this observation. There, I thought that it could be a \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lecanora\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eLecanora\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e; It was a clearly mature specimen, the apothecia were much wider than those I was looking for and the thallus was not as thin as I recall (see \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/215228\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobservation 215228\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and compare). I spent more than two hours in the Juniperus shrubs around looking for what I had already encountered, without knowing.

At the time I had doubts about the genus of that specimen. Recently I found again one specimen,  treated in \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/238525\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobservation 238525\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and conclude that it must belong to the genus \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Catillaria\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eCatillaria\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, but again I could not count the number of spores per ascus. There I recall the present understanding of that genus (though the Sonoran Flora Vol. III has almost 10 years, the British Flora from 2009 gave the same characterization) and I repeat it here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‚ÄúCatillaria in the broadest sense is characterized by lecideine to biatorine apothecia with small to moderate-sized, hyaline, 1-septate spores usually 8/ascus. It is still heterogeneous, and its relationships to other genera have not yet been fully clarified. Catillaria s. str. is characterized by asci with uniformly K/I+ blue apical dome, the abruptly swollen paraphysis tips with a dark brown cap, non-halonate ascospores, and the conidogenous cells in chains‚Äù.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs all the others, this specimen grew on wood of Juniperus shrubs. As in \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/238525\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobservation 238525\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, I include a photo illustrating the features of the genus in this specimen. This time I could get photos of the asci which clearly show that the number of spores is much bigger than 8. I cannot say for sure how many they are but certainly more than 20. In the set of photos labeled \u0026#8220;Asci\u0026#8221; the first photo shows an ascus where some spores are already out and one can count 14 spores inside. All the other asci in that photo set have more spores than the first one. The problem is that all the species considered in the Sonoran Flora have asci 8-spored and only one species with more than 8 spores per ascus is cited in the British Flora, namely \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Catillaria+gilbertii\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eC. gilbertii\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e with 16 spores; however, this species is described as saxicolous. \u003cbr /\u003e\nTherefore, I have to look to other more recent references to see if there is anything similar to the specimens that I have been observed that may all belong to the same species.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2250,"consensus_id":58600,"consensus_name":"Catillaria praedicta","location_id":13724,"location_name":"Paimogo, Lourinh√£, Portugal","primary_image_id":620741},{"id":239867,"type":"observation","date":"2016-05-21","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.59294,"created_at":"2016-05-26T23:27:01.000Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T23:27:09.000Z","number_of_views":65,"last_viewed":"2024-04-18T14:15:06.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eI could not believe what I was seeing: A lirellate lichen with green apothecia!

Only after I started to photograph it with my macro-lens I observed something closely resembling tiny sporocarps of a fungus on plant\u0026#8217;s stem. Excited I thought I found an interesting ascomycete on an unusual host. Only later under the microscope I realized that this could not be so. To my knowledge structures observed could not be explained as something pertaining to fungi world. Having no clue what it might be I sent the photos to Mgr. Gabriel Seljak at Agriculture and Forestry Institute, Nova Gorica. He kindly explained me that such structures are most probably build by certain insects, either plant eating bugs of suborder Heteroptera or insects of the family Cicadidae. They put their eggs into a wound made by a sharp special organ. Which species is especially interested in orchids is an interesting question?

Starting with a section of an apothecium immediatly realized to be in presence of something completely different than thought. Going further the KOH reaction on the section was negative, simply enhanced the yellowish coloration of a part of the hymenium. Further, pressing the slide could see paraphyses with dark tips but not much enlarged and small asci, clavate and somewhat flexuosus, containing 8 hyaline 1-septate spores inside. The asci apex showed a big tholus and a prominent apical beak, like that in Bacidia-type asci. This was unexpected and the first task was to establish the genus of this specimen. Using Ref. 2 the answer was \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lecania\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eLecania\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr /\u003e\nMy knowledge of this genus is very limited and I only identified before one of its species, but not based on microscopic properties.

Before it is worth mention that many small crystals were found in the slides, that to a certain extent caused several difficulties in the observation of asci and spores.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn the  Sonoran Flora Vol. 2, I was lead to a group of species formed by  \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lecania+chalcophila\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eL. chalcophila\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lecania+rayiana\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eL. rayiana\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lecania+turicensis\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eL turicensis\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

If this is so, than most of the above cited species are ruled out (by having \u0026#8220;Bacidia-type asci\u0026#8221;, according to the Sonoran Flora) with the exception of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lecania+sylvestris\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eL. sylvestris\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, according to Ref. 3.
