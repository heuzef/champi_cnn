Also reported from Argentina, Australia, Baja Mexico, Chile, Iran, Mexico, Spain, Nepal, and Uruguay.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHabitat: Calvatia pachyderma is said to have an amphitropical distribution of mostly temperate regions, and being discontinuous between Northern and Southern hemispheres (Ponce de Leon, 1976). Occurring in the fall after light rain, and sometimes in spring after heavy rain. Collected in grassy lawns where grass appears scant and patchy, on open grassland, in pastures, on ranch land, among Quercus lobata (valley oak), Quercus agrifolia (coast live oak), and found in clay-rich humiferous soils. Growing in fairy rings, in groups of two or three, touching but not fused, or solitarily. Growing on ground with frequent foot traffic, or periodic vehicle traffic and somewhat shaded areas. Due to teeth makings on the gasterocarps, young fruitbodies were noticed to be nibbled on by cows and small rodents. Among the Geographic Subdivisions of California, this species is found in the southern regions of Northwestern California, in the western regions of the Sierra Nevada, in Central Western California, and in South Western California.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":1622,"consensus_name":"Calvatia pachyderma","location_id":10884,"location_name":"Yellow Jacket Ranch, Knights Valley, Calistoga, Napa Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1107199},{"id":388318,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-12","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"altitude":973,"gps_hidden":true,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.21991,"created_at":"2019-10-18T18:06:50.000Z","updated_at":"2023-03-24T03:23:49.000Z","number_of_views":70,"last_viewed":"2024-02-25T08:34:27.000Z","owner_id":600,"consensus_id":112571,"consensus_name":"Clitocybe \"sp-CA01\"","location_id":21431,"location_name":"South Boundary Trail, Glacier National Park, Montana, USA","primary_image_id":1109340},{"id":388319,"type":"observation","date":"2008-11-21","latitude":"39.6342","longitude":"-120.551","altitude":1799,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.47201,"created_at":"2019-10-18T18:07:36.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T18:07:38.000Z","number_of_views":41,"last_viewed":"2023-09-27T17:44:04.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eTaxonomic details:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13555\"\u003ehttps://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13555\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDistribution: Known only from the Western United States, and previously reported from California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHabitat: Growing among Calocedrus decurrens (incense cedar), Pinus ponderosa ponderosa pine), Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas fir), under Abies spp. (fir) trees, and other conifers and hardwoods.

Johnston (CG Lloyd Mycological Collection #33650; BPI706673; TYPE). \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nComments:  Johnston (type collection notes, 1917) writes, “this impressed me at once by its exceptionally black endoperidium. It has the habits, and I thought at first was a Bovista, but the capillitium is of a Catastoma and in these intermediate species the capillitium characters decide.”  He goes on to say that this does not have the ‘mouth down’ character normal to Disciseda, so this is not ideal for the Disciseda genera. However, there are many Disciseda species that do not exhibit the rolling over behavior. Zeller (1947) describes Disciseda atra with the appearance of a black weathered oak gall, without a sand case, an exoperidium that closely adheres to the endoperidium, and being so similar to D. candida as to confuse them for one another. Disciseda atra was put into synonymy with D. candida by Cunningham (1979) for this reason. Disciseda atra, needs additional collections of material at all ranges of maturity to be further understood. Evidence based on morphology, SEM, and ITS data, suggests that D. atra is conspecific with D. levispora, and both are nested within the Calvatia clade on the ML tree with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP. In 1972 A.H. Smith annotated the type specimen of Disciseda levispora, (seen on type specimen notes) suggesting that it was Calvatia hesperia (Morgan) 1895, which was described from Pasadena, CA, and the data here supports this contention. Both D. atra and D. levispora were originally described from Southern California, Orange County and Riverside County, respectively. When comparing the descriptions of Calvatia hesperia (both Morgan 1895, and Ponce de Leon 1976) to descriptions of Disciseda atra and Disciseda levispora, there is a great deal of similarity. None of these descriptions mention a sand case, they all have a hard or coriaceous endoperidium, a thin exoperidium that adheres to the endoperidium, the same size and ornamentation of the spores, similar size and characters in the eucapillitium, and all seem to prefer sandy soil or growing on the terra firma. One main difference is the size of the gasterocarps, however Morgan notes that this species is “quite variable in size.”  Another difference is the color of the gleba, which could be explained by differences in maturation of gasterocarps used in the descriptions. Kreisel (1989) transferred Calvatia hesperia into Handkea, probably due to Ponce de Leon (1976) stating “the pits slit-like,” and here Kreisel notes “no specimen seen.” Disciseda atra was the only species among the California taxa seen with slit-like pits (using SEM), for which these pits looked morphologically derived and not like cracks in the eucapillitium walls (see fig. 16). Disciseda levispora and Disciseda atra were both transferred from Catastoma in the same paper (Zeller 1947). If these two are to remain in Disciseda, D. atra may become the preferred name for these two taxa, based on alphabetical preference. However, since their position in the ML tree is within the Calvatia clade with good support, a transfer to Calvatia may be warranted. Calvatia hesperia is the older name of these three, this is a distinct taxon, and all of this evidence combined suggests that Calvatia hesperia may be a well-suited name for both Disciseda atra and Disciseda levispora.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":109108,"consensus_name":"Disciseda atra","location_id":21435,"location_name":"Mount San Antonio, Angeles National Forest, California, USA","primary_image_id":1107251},{"id":388339,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-14","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.840061,"created_at":"2019-10-18T23:40:52.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-19T00:01:04.000Z","number_of_views":51,"last_viewed":"2024-03-16T03:21:51.000Z","owner_id":5202,"consensus_id":43030,"consensus_name":"Panaeolus reticulatus","location_id":12161,"location_name":"Burpee Mills, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":1107257},{"id":388340,"type":"observation","date":"1917-09-01","latitude":"24.7957","longitude":"-107.42","altitude":36,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.47404,"created_at":"2019-10-19T00:03:35.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-19T00:03:37.000Z","number_of_views":91,"last_viewed":"2024-03-14T23:57:12.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFull taxonomic details:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13557\"\u003ehttps://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13557\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHabitat: In open barren soil in the summer, growing solitarily.

Brandege (type collection notes: 1917) states that this type specimen is young, yet is different from all other Disciseda species due to smooth spores. Describing a new species, with only immature specimens available, seems typical of taxonomy at the turn of the century. Today, with more knowledge of the habits of these fungi, smooth spores often points to immature material, and therefore most often these specimens remain unidentifiable.

Lloyd (1908) notes that this species is very similar to a common species, Catastoma circumscissum, but distinct in it’s smooth spores, growing with its ‘mouth down,’ as is character to Disciseda. However, the holotype material clearly has echinulate spores. It is possible that the holotype material is immature, and further collections need to be examined to make a complete diagnosis on this species. Disciseda johnstonii, without further collection of material at all ranges of maturity, will remain incompletely understood. The ITS data here supports this species within a Disciseda clade with 84% bootstrap and 98% PP.  \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNotes on the Genera:\u003cbr /\u003e\nDisciseda Czern., Bull. Soc. Imp. nat. Moscou 18(2, III): 153. 1845.\u003cbr /\u003e\nType: Disciseda collabescens Czern. [as \u0026#8216;collabascens\u0026#8217;], Bull. Soc. Imp. nat. Moscou 18(2, III): 153. 1845.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\tDisciseda was erected by Czerniaiev in 1845, but his work was not well known at the time. Several species of Disciseda remained in Bovista until 1892, when Morgan segregated those with a basal sand case into a new genus, Catastoma. In 1903 Dr. L. Hollós recognized this duplication of efforts and transferred many species of Catastoma into Disciseda (Lloyd 1906). Zeller (1947) described several new species of Disciseda, transferring some of them from Catastoma, of which most of these originate from California. Catastoma means mouth down, as is the very nature from which the stoma develops in many species. On the grounds of priority, Disciseda is the oldest valid generic name. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\tThe development of the stoma in Disciseda is a unique feature. Many mycologists (Lloyd 1903, Lohwag 1930, Coker and Couch 1928, Ahmad 1950, Mitchel et al. 1975) argue that the stoma develops as the fruitbody matures, rolls over, and is torn from a basal attachment off of a rhizomorph or mycelium tuft that remains in the substrate. Hence, the bottom becomes the top in this rolling over manner. Most species grow subhypogeous to hypogeous, and to this day little is known about the early fruitbody development of this group of fungi. This unique and very small globose to ovate puffball does not always have a basal opening. Several species develop an apical stoma in the usual manner (Coker and Couch 1928, Ahmad 1950, Mitchel et al. 1975). \u003cbr /\u003e\n\tHowever, in the case of Disciseda cervina, Ahmad (1950) surveyed hundreds of specimens and observed them in a natural setting for several days. His findings described the exoperidium sand case eroding from the base upwards until only an apical cap remained. As the fruitbody matured, the rhizomorph remained attached at the base, keeping the fruitbody in place in the soil. Ahmad reports that after ten days, the fruitbody appeared gelatinized at the base and the rhizomorph was easily pulled out leaving a pore, or stoma, in its place. The wind typically worked the fruitbody of Disciseda cervina out of its original location, rolling it over, and the bottom became the top with the new stoma at the apex. Disciseda can be collected in arid grass landscapes, in sandy dune habitats, and in areas with constant dry and windy conditions. When collecting fungi from this genus, it is important to treat each individual fruitbody as an individual collection. Terrain in which Disciseda is found may have a variety of species, making mixed collections possible. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\tThe genus Disciseda currently has thirty-seven species that have been recorded in Index Fungorum, fourty-six including all varieties.

Crawford (type specimen notes, 1916) writes in his holotype specimen notes, “Similar to Catastoma pedicellatum and Catastoma pila. As to spores, there is but one other species with smooth spores; Catastoma brandegeei, which is a much smaller plant and has olive gleba.”  Evidence based on morphology, SEM, and ITS data, suggests that D. levispora is a synonym of that D. atra. In 1972 A.H. Smith annotated the type specimen of Disciseda levispora, suggesting that it was Calvatia hesperia (Morgan,) 1895, which was described from Pasadena, CA. Both D. atra and D. levispora were also described from Southern California; Orange County and Riverside County, respectively. When comparing the descriptions of Calvatia hesperia (both Morgan 1895, and Ponce de Leon 1976) to descriptions of Disciseda atra and Disciseda levispora, there is a great deal of similarity. None of these descriptions mention a sand case, they all have a hard or coriaceous endoperidium, a thin exoperidium that adheres to the endoperidium, the same size and ornamentation of the spores, similar size and characters in the eucapillitium, and they all seem to prefer sandy soil or growing on the terra firma. The original description of Calvatia hesperia states a gleba with clay color, greenish to ochraceous. A brief glance of images of the type collections at NY, show the gleba color matching that of both D. atra and D. levispora. However, this is not enough evidence to support a change in nomenclature. Since their position in the ML tree is within the Calvatia clade with good support, a transfer to Calvatia may be warranted. The type collections of Calvatia hesperia, Disciseda atra, and Disciseda levispora need further comparison before any names are transferred, especially with multi loci genes in phylogenetic analysis. If Disciseda levispora and Disciseda atra are to remain in Disciseda, D. atra may become the preferred name for these two taxa, based on alphabetical preference. However, Calvatia hesperia is the older name of the three, this is a distinct taxon, and all of this evidence combined here suggests that Calvatia hesperia may be a well-suited name for both Disciseda atra and Disciseda levispora.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":109110,"consensus_name":"Disciseda levispora","location_id":15355,"location_name":"Claremont, Berkeley, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1107606},{"id":388474,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-04","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"altitude":168,"gps_hidden":true,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.56866,"created_at":"2019-10-19T20:06:18.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-19T20:06:20.000Z","number_of_views":29,"last_viewed":"2021-11-15T02:01:26.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eA pair fruiting in grass on residential property.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6466,"consensus_id":417,"consensus_name":"Scleroderma bovista","location_id":11122,"location_name":"West St. Louis Co., Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":1107614},{"id":388475,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-19","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.853077,"created_at":"2019-10-19T20:15:17.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-20T03:55:35.000Z","number_of_views":26,"last_viewed":"2022-02-04T10:18:44.000Z","owner_id":27152,"consensus_id":20650,"consensus_name":"Cortinarius","location_id":21711,"location_name":"Tyler Bend, Arkansas, USA","primary_image_id":1107623},{"id":388476,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-03","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"altitude":133,"gps_hidden":true,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.56869,"created_at":"2019-10-19T20:29:32.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-19T20:29:34.000Z","number_of_views":25,"last_viewed":"2023-09-23T16:13:05.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eSeveral scattered in suburban residential lawn.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6466,"consensus_id":20311,"consensus_name":"Calvatia craniiformis","location_id":11122,"location_name":"West St. Louis Co., Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":1107624},{"id":388477,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-19","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.85308,"created_at":"2019-10-19T20:33:11.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T08:58:08.000Z","number_of_views":24,"last_viewed":"2023-09-08T23:26:37.000Z","owner_id":30322,"consensus_id":864,"consensus_name":"Psathyrella","location_id":21322,"location_name":"Forst, Brandenburg, Germany","primary_image_id":1107635},{"id":388478,"type":"observation","date":"2019-07-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.86766,"created_at":"2019-10-19T20:36:56.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T20:48:21.000Z","number_of_views":20,"last_viewed":"2023-09-15T03:21:50.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eThis slime was growing on a tree.

Very close in general character to Catastoma hypogeum of Australia, which however has slightly roughened spores.

Disciseda candida is often misidentified as Disciseda subterranea due to the spores being coarsely warted, uniformly globose, apedicellate (under light microscopy), and of an overall gasterocarp size that fits within the literature describing D. subterranea (Mitchel 1975). These two species are reported as growing side by side, and often collected with each other (Mitchel 1975). Since the gasterocarps look almost identical to the untrained eye, especially young basidiocarps, close examination of each fruitbody is important for proper determination of species. Disciseda subterranea can be recognized by: echinate spores that look bumpy with clumpy globs in KOH mounts in light microscopy, spores with a short apiculus, pores on the eucapillitium will be absent or scarce, and the gasterocarps should be growing subhypogeous. If the fruitbodies are not partially submerged in the ground, check the spores carefully for echinate ornamentation. Disciseda candid has eucapillitium with pores that are abundant in clusters, and verrucose spores. Spores mounted in KOH, of D. candida and D. subterranea, for a side by side comparison, will reveal a halo around the spores. Disciseda subterranea has more prominent halo due to larger echinate ornamentation, versus the thinner halo from the verrucose spores of D. candida, (see fig. 18.3 and 23.3 for a comparison). The ITS data here supports this species outside of the Lycoperdaceae, nested with Disciseda uplandii, with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP support. The ITS data shows Disciseda as a polyphyletic assemblage, at four points in the tree. This suggests that additional genes of multiple species of Disciseda should be sequenced to further clarify the taxonomic position of the genus amongst the other Lycoperdaceae.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":2141,"consensus_name":"Disciseda subterranea","location_id":1418,"location_name":"Deep Springs Valley, Inyo Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1107646},{"id":388482,"type":"observation","date":"1991-05-09","latitude":"34.1411","longitude":"-117.7105","altitude":491,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.74099,"created_at":"2019-10-19T22:07:57.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-20T05:13:20.000Z","number_of_views":150,"last_viewed":"2024-04-18T00:02:35.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFor full taxonomic details\u0026quot;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13564\"\u003ehttps://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13564\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHabitat: Terrestrial in open grass at 365 meters (1,200 feet) elevation.

Among the Geographic Subdivisions of California, this species is known form Southwestern California province. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDistribution: Known only from California and previously reported from Sacramento County, San Bernardino County, and Riverside County. \t\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nComments:  Lloyd (1922) notes that this species is very close to Catastoma muelleri from Australia, known only by type specimen examination from KEW; spores being the main difference. Disciseda uplandii and Catastoma muelleri both have rough spores under light microscopy, however, the spines on C. muelleri spores are three to four times as long as those of D. uplandii. It could be safe to assume with this notation from Lloyd, that under SEM imaging, C. muelleri would have echinate spores, whereas D. uplandii has verrucose spores. “These are the only two species in the purplish series with apiculate spores, all others are pedicellate,” Lloyd, (1922). Disciseda uplandii differs from other Disciseda species in that it has a reduced sterile base and abundantly pitted eucapillitium. Unlike other Disciseda, which do not have a sterile base, and may have pits that are absent, scattered or clustered, but pits not as abundant as in D. uplandii. This character of having abundant pits mirrors that of a Lycoperdon species. Zeller (1947) notes that Disciseda uplandii has a gleba that corresponds to the Mesophelliaceae and the Geastraceae, without notation of what specific gleba character he is referencing. The ITS data here supports this species outside of the Lycoperdaceae, nested with Disciseda subterranea with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP support. The ITS data shows Disciseda as a polyphyletic assemblage, at four points in the tree. This suggests that additional genes of multiple species of Disciseda should be sequenced to further clarify the taxonomic position of the genus amongst the other Lycoperdaceae. Disciseda uplandii, without further collection of material at all ranges of maturity, and multi loci gene analysis, this species will remain incompletely understood.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaterial Examined: CALIFORNIA, San Bernardino Co.: Upland, terrestrial, 25 December 1918, I.M.
