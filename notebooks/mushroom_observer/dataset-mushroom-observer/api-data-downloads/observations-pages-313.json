attachment. Individual frb diameter rarely exceeds 3 mm. Frbs spread rather than open as they develop. Fertile surface irregularly convex to flat, smooth, and moderately shiny. Typically bright yellow to golden but pale yellow where not exposed to light. Margins appear slightly translucent. Frbs dry to orange. No marginal hairs seen. Exterior surfaces paler, possibly finely hairy at 10\u0026#215;. Dry frbs revive when rehydrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttachment: central, translucent “root” to 2 mm long, penetrating the outer layers of context.

The lack of spore septation is at variance from the published description of Dacrymyces variisporus. However, Reid (1974) says, “it would seem likely that in some species at least it is a common occurrence for the spores to be shed in a non-septate condition, and that they only become septate prior to germination when trapped on the gelatinous fruitbody. This same phenomenon was observed by Coker (1920) in ‘D. abietinus (Pers.) Schroeter’ (probably = D. variisporus\u003cbr /\u003e\nMcNabb) who noted that the spores in a fresh print were non-septate although they became 7-septate after about a week.”\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4931,"consensus_id":27308,"consensus_name":"Dacrymyces variisporus","location_id":3730,"location_name":"Buncombe Co., North Carolina, USA","primary_image_id":971107},{"id":347857,"type":"observation","date":"2018-08-19","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.847574,"created_at":"2018-11-28T16:43:31.000Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T16:57:23.000Z","number_of_views":19,"last_viewed":"2022-09-17T07:25:08.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003emixed forest \u0026#8211; but, in an area with mostly eastern hemlock.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":8700,"consensus_id":6013,"consensus_name":"Lactarius rufus","location_id":13619,"location_name":"Sharon, Connecticut, USA","primary_image_id":971109},{"id":347858,"type":"observation","date":"2018-08-19","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.33386,"created_at":"2018-11-28T16:49:04.000Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T18:15:28.000Z","number_of_views":24,"last_viewed":"2024-04-16T15:04:35.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing on a rotting log in a mixed forest, but in a mostly coniferous area.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":8700,"consensus_id":1177,"consensus_name":"Lentinellus","location_id":13619,"location_name":"Sharon, Connecticut, USA","primary_image_id":971112},{"id":347859,"type":"observation","date":"2018-08-19","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69515,"created_at":"2018-11-28T16:56:43.000Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T17:01:31.000Z","number_of_views":13,"last_viewed":"2024-04-08T12:29:46.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eDingy white cap, nearly flat, and with an inrolled margin.
