The reads overlap in the middle for ~300 bps to give the so called “joined contig”; the overlapping segment is an example of “consensus contig”.  Unlike it’s often the case with nrITS, it’s not possible to get a full-length \u003cins\u003econsensus\u003c/ins\u003e sequence for LSU with just two reads due to the length of the amplified span of DNA from the start of the locus to the LR7 primer area (usually ~1450 bps long!). Since all reads gradually begin to lose resolution after 600 bps (due to broadening of peak shapes), legible spans of \u0026gt;800-900 bps from single reads are uncommon.  However, if individual reads are of good quality, joined contigs are a perfectly satisfactory result.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e A BLASTn-250 of the first 922 bps, the most commonly sequenced region of nrLSU (upstream of the LR5 primer area), gave Rod Tulloss’ (RET’s) accession of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Amanita+rhopalopus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eAmanita rhopalopus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (HQ539733) as the top hit at 98.6% similarity.

Strangely, the remaining 11 mismatching positions come from a short stretch of DNA the middle in the sequence, and are closely spaced – the first and last mismatches are only 30 characters apart.  Five of these appear to be part of variable-length repeating motifs, e.g., “ATAT” or “TTTT”, and can probably be dismissed, as well.
