Looking at the description of this taxon in \u003cem\u003eThe Boletes of Michigan\u003c/em\u003e, the salient morphological features are the colors of the cap and stipe and the intense bluing, but IMO this gestalt is similar to that of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lanmaoa+pseudosensibilis\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eL. pseudosensibilis\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, also described by the two gents on the adjacent page of TBofMI.
