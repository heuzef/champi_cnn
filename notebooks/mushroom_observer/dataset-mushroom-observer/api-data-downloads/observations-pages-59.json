But reading through the notes in the Antonin book on Marasmioid fungi, it seems that these are best matched to M. wynneae.  Some of the differences here with the normal discr. is that it should have cheilocystidia at least, the caulocystidia should be more cylindrical and blunt, and the lamellae context should be dextrinoid.  But the cheilocystidia are clavate to wavy cyndrical, and I might have missed them in the basidia.  Also the desc. has these as off-white and not striate, but in the notes, Antonin mentions the variation of the cap in the species, with colors from brown to grey to white.
