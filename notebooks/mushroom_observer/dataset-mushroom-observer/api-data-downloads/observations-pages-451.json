It is light greenish/grey with white patches on the outer edges. The underside of this lichen is greyish/brown. It is also lacking soredia and isidia when closely examined. I performed a KOH test on the surface of the lichen and the test was positive. I then performed another KOH test on the medullary layer and that test was negative. This told me that it was a Physcia species. I made a slide of an apothecia as shown below.
