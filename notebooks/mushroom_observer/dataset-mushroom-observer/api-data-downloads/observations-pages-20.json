In\u003cbr /\u003e\nprimordium, basidiomata are covered with tall, white conic spines forming a universal veil that entirely encloses the basidiomata.  As they mature and the pileus expands and the stipe elongates, these UV spines fall off and leave a pileus with a minutely granulose surface.  The UV spines are formed from chains of thick-walled, spinose and spinulose cells called cherocytes, each of which can disarticulate and act as an asexual propagule, individually germinating to form dikaryotic hyphae.  We have observed  both arthropods and molluscs feeding on young basidiomata and carrying fragments of UV on their bodies.  Mycena spinosissima  is rarely collected but widespread in Central and South America and was probably introduced to the Hawaiian Islands with plants or animals from the New World.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8212;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMirrored on iNaturalist as \u003ca href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/131531558\"\u003eobservation 131531558\u003c/a\u003e on August 19, 2022.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":181,"consensus_id":25252,"consensus_name":"Mycena sect.
