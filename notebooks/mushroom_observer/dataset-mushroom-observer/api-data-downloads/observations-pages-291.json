need a little help identifying this Bolete. Found in Western North Carolina. Under pine and chestnut trees. Ground is a mix of moss and grass. Cap has no flavor and a very mild scent. Some were quite large, over 6 inches but I only collected specimens that were 4 and 5 inches in cap diameter. Pores bruise blue immediately and then turn to brown. Cap does not bruise. Spore print is brown. Texture is dry and fleshy. Stems short. Younger specimens the stems are much thinner about 1- 1.5 cm. Older specimens were twice that. Red at the base of the stem fading to a yellowish color. I think it is Boletus pallidoroseus. I do not trust myself yet and would greatly appreciate any of your input.
