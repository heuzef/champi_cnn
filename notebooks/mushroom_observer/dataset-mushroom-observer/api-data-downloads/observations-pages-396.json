It was derived entirely from the reverse read that required manual resolution of two haplotypes due to a single point of heterogeneity in the early ITS1 region.  The forward read would have been essential in simplifying the task of assembling a joined contig in this scenario, had it not suffered from substantial noise in early ITS1 up to the point of heterogeneity, rendering it essentially useless.  The haplotypes are present in ~1.2:1 ratio (area under the curve), favoring the shorter one that has TT vs. the one with the extra T.  The ITS sequence is bookended on the 5\u0026#8217; end by the last 46 characters of nrSSU and by the first 24 characters of nrLSU on the 3\u0026#8217; end.  A single ambiguity, \u0026#8220;M\u0026#8221; (A/C), is seen in the ITS1 sublocus in the reverse read.  This, however, gets resolved in the forward read due to the 1-base frame shift; the major/shorter haplotype has a \u0026#8220;C\u0026#8221; there.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe ITS sequence is 99.68% identical to that of \u003ccite\u003eTricholoma columbetta\u003c/cite\u003e neotype, LT000017.  The two mismatching positions involve ambiguities (R, R) in the holotype sequence.
