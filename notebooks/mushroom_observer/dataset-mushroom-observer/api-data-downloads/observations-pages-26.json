This is possible a species of Beauveria fungus which is similar to Metarhizium anisopliae. This is used to, among other things, attack the Australian plague locust. It seems likely that the spider gets infected by the fungus which then takes 10-14 days to kill it. It then continues to grow (like this) and will presumably produce some fruiting bodies.

The litter was pinus radiata sawdust which was used to absorb the urine from the lambs.
