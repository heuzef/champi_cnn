Overall height = 9.5 cm.  The cap is 9 cm wide and 2.5 cm thick above the stipe.  The tube layer is 5-7 mm wide.  The stipe is 7 cm long, 2.2 cm wide at the flaring apex, 1.8 cm wide at the narrowest point, and 2 cm wide at the base.  The cap flesh is pale yellow, bluing instantly.  The stipe flesh is concolorous with the cap in the upper 1/4, and increasingly bright lemon yellow below, bluing instantly in the upper 2/3 only.  The bluing eventually subsides and changes over to reddish-brown, consistent with the species concept.  The odor is fungoid, with a sour and fishy note.  KOH = rusty orange-brown on the pellicle, light pinkish-orange on cap context; NH4OH = pale blue flash on contact with cap pellicle, resolving rusty orange-brown, pale pinkish-orange on cap context.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eDNA Sequencing Results \u0026amp; Discussion\u003c/b\u003e (posted on 16-Jul-22):\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis collection was sampled for ITS and TEF-1 loci by Dr. Kudzma upon my request. The TEF-1 data hasn\u0026#8217;t been processed yet, so the discussion will focus on the spacer.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe ITS marker in this organism is quite a mess due to the presence of at least three and as many as four haplotypes, manifested by 4 (!) distinct points of heterogeneity \u0026#8212; one in early ITS1 region and the rest in the ITS2 region \u0026#8211; stemming from variable-length homopolymers.  This is, perhaps, the most complicated case of heterogeneity I successfully dealt with through the combination of a careful and patient manual resolution of haplotypes in the raw reads and subsequent modeling of sequence overlays to explain the peak patterns observed the chromatograms.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt\u0026#8217;s very curious that all the haplotypes are of the same length because the ITS locus starts off as a single set of peaks and also ends as a single set of peaks, as seen in the forward read.  However, their internal compositions varies as single bases are inserted and deleted in a unique fashion at the four indicated locations.  The haplotype ratio is inferred from the approximate area under the curve and that\u0026#8217;s how the sequence variants can be traced. \u003cbr /\u003e\nHerein, I report only two main haplotypes, Hap-1 \u0026amp; Hap-2, because they stand out and their identity, IMO, is well-supported.  The presence the third ITS variant is inferred from the region between the two internal points of heterogeneity separated by only 42 bases within the ITS2 sublocus (it perfectly blends in with the other two variants everywhere else in the reads and becomes \u0026#8220;invisible\u0026#8221;).  This brief sequence segment consists of a triple peaks at each position.  It is not possible to establish the exact origin of this variant with certainty \u0026#8211; not even from the peak ratios \u0026#8211; without doing bacterial cloning or sequencing with NexGen methodology, as it can be the derivative of either or even both reported haplotypes (in case there are 4 variants).  \u003cb\u003eFig. 1\u003c/b\u003e shows MUSCLE alignment of the three full-length ITS haplotypes and the differences between them.  Hap-3 is the presumed sneaky minor component not submitted to GenBank.  Removal of the gaps will reproduce the actual peak pattern seen in the chromatograms and will not change their overall length, which, as already stated above, is the same for all ITS variants.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1539,"consensus_id":49807,"consensus_name":"Lanmaoa pseudosensibilis","location_id":7327,"location_name":"Maple Shade Twp., Burlington Co., New Jersey, USA","primary_image_id":943517},{"id":339051,"type":"observation","date":"2018-10-13","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.68931,"created_at":"2018-10-14T19:11:42.000Z","updated_at":"2018-10-14T19:11:47.000Z","number_of_views":22,"last_viewed":"2022-09-14T15:44:35.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing at the base of very mature sweetgum.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":12311,"consensus_id":1169,"consensus_name":"Bondarzewia berkeleyi","location_id":18213,"location_name":"Indian Springs State Park, Flovilla, Georgia, USA","primary_image_id":943525},{"id":339052,"type":"observation","date":"2018-10-14","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.830898,"created_at":"2018-10-14T19:24:43.000Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T03:21:46.000Z","number_of_views":46,"last_viewed":"2024-01-10T20:07:06.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound on the forest floor\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":13578,"consensus_id":388,"consensus_name":"Agaricus","location_id":18933,"location_name":"Springs, New York, USA","primary_image_id":943529},{"id":339053,"type":"observation","date":"2018-10-13","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.35657,"created_at":"2018-10-14T19:29:12.000Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T12:55:02.000Z","number_of_views":25,"last_viewed":"2022-11-22T22:32:05.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing terrestrially in predominantly hardwood, mixed woods (Hemlock, Oak, Pine, Sweetgum, Maple).
