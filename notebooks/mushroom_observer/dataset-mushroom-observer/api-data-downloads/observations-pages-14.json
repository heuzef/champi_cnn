is my first post on this website, so any suggestions are welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was found here in Central Missouri late this spring, June 7th growing on or near a huge dead log. [Sorry, I don\u0026#8217;t recall if it was growing on the unknown type of log, or if I put it up on the log as a place to take it\u0026#8217;s picture.] It was in a very damp bottom land of the Missouri river where there was a mixture of (hard)woods, with few if any conifers. The pictures I\u0026#8217;ll attach show three different cap sizes with a progression from a nice contrasting pattern of dark fiber scales on a very light brown background on the smallest cap (about the size of a nickel) to the medium cap with a blending of pattern into the cap (about the size of a half-dollar), finally to the largest cap in which the pattern is most blended into a light brown/fawn color (no more than 2\u0026quot; or 5 cm in diameter). I didn\u0026#8217;t get the spore print, but I\u0026#8217;d guess it to be brown, judging from the gill coloration progressing from very light tan to a solid medium cocoa brown. The stalk is smooth, white, without scales or color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really like this one because of it\u0026#8217;s cap pattern and change.

I have dried the caps for potential spore use later, and have sliced and diced the stipes (what huge stipes!) for later consumption.

I didn\u0026#8217;t have a camera with me and meant to go back to take a picture but, alas, I forgot. By the time I remembered they were all shriveled. It kind of looks like a nose in profile, albeit an ochre colored one. There were flaking scales on it. I had to cut it to see it\u0026#8217;s innards and it was a tough little thing! The flap on the bottom was red inside with white spores deposited on it. The pale tan pores bruised reddish when fondled. I was curious as to why the pores and spores would be contained within such a tough skin. Mykoweb says that this species uses insects, who chew holes through the covering, and also carry spores about with them, for dispersal.

But with this long a stipe (nearly 3 inches long!), it is nearly impossible to be sure until microscopy has been done. This specimen is currently being dehydrated, and will be added to ths OSU Herbarium. Found near the top of Larch Mountain growing off a large well-rotted Noble fir log without any bark left on it. The stipe is 3 inches long, and the lower inch is bright yellow but the extreme base (last 1/4 inch or so) composed of white matted rhizomorphs separating into distinct white rhizomorphs extending at least 1/2 inch from the stipe. Portion of stipe above log surface is striate brownish-red (i.e. mostly red with some brown areas under certain lighting conditions), annulus present, dark brown, just underneath cap attachment. Much of the stipe appears hollow, but I\u0026#8217;m going to leave the stipe whole for further researchers to check. Flesh of cap yellow to straw-colored, staining red when cut. Top of cap felty red, with some brown fibrils mixed in; rim of cap upturned, dark red or nearly black red. Tubes are complex, mostly sealed/closed, but with some open to the air, moist to the touch. Trying to get spore print now, but don\u0026#8217;t have much hope. Most Gastroboletus I\u0026#8217;ve been exposed to have more complex tubes that stain quickly blue.
