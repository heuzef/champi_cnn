It is strictly bound to Larix decidua trees and best recognized by large angular pores and the fact that it is, frankly speaking, an ugly mushroom of indefinite color somewhere among dirty white, gray, beige or pale brown. The whole mushroom is like this. When I first found it I didn\u0026#8217;t take pictures of it because I thought it was already decayed and therefore determination impossible.
