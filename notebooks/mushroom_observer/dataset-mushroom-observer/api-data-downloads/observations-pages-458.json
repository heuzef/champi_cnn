They were left on the table and I took them home. The tag says they were collected in leaf litter.  The soil was clay and very dry.  When fresh, they were 1-2cm.  The peridium was thin, cream colored with a flush of pink.  The gleba was white with a potato like texture. It had a small stipe attaching the fungus to the soil.  I did not look at these fungi until the next day because I figured they were Rhizopogon.  Looking at the spores under the microscope the next day, I realized that they were nothing like Rhizopogon spores but more like Russula (including amyloid reaction).  My husband then took over and found this weird sequestrate Russula which does not look like a Russula at all.  There are very few collections and they seem to be all from the west coast.
