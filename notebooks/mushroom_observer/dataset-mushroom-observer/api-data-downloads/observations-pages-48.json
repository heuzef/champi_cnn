The first photo is of the freshest collection, showing them with a translucent hygrophanous cap, and striate.  I had made three different collections of them in the area, but they all turned out to be the same species.  The second shot shows a dryer one, and the third shot shows an older one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  Here there are lots of cystidia on a non-fertile edge, they are fusiod, acute, and slightly wavy.  Also no pleurocystidia were observed, some 4-spored basidia were seen, and the spores were non-dextrinoid.  No reactions to the Meltzer\u0026#8217;s were seen in any tissues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of cap surface at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The cap is a cutis, and no pileocystidia were obs.  Also no gelatin were seen, the cap hyphae are rather inflated and clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of caulocystidia at 400x in KOH.  They are lageniform to cylindrical mostly, a few were clavate to globose.  Numerous at the apex, no cystidia were seen at the stipe base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.

The over-all look to them is like a Pholiotina, with the light brown spore color, but the cap surface would put it in Galerina with the cutis.  The cystidia remind me of some Psilocybe/Deconica, not really Galerina.  The spores are too smooth with the germ pore to be Galerina, and not thick walled or angular enough for Deconica, so my bast guess on where to put them is Phaeogalera.

Pleurocystidia are uncertain, some obs. but rare, and usually need the gill edge, also gill were old and very full of spores.  4-spored basidia, spores with uncertain dextrinoid reaction, many with no reaction, some with a slightly brick-red reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot of the stip apex at 400x in KOH.  The caulocystidia are fusiod-ventricose, many with sub-capitate ends.  Cystidia obs. at the apex and base of the stipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth micro-shot is of the spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are ellipsoid, roughened, with a clear plage on most.  Slightly small for a Galerina, with an apr. size of 8 \u0026#215; 5 um.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting this together I was confused for awhile.  Back and forth, and it didn\u0026#8217;t help things with the uncertain pleurocystidia.  But it looks like the best id here is Galerina triscopa on these.
