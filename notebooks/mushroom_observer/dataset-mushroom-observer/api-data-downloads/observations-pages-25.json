Unfortunately there was a hard frost that evening and development was arrested at this stage. I cut one of the red globules open and it WAS filled with pink paste. I guess what clinched it for me was the illustration of the L. epidendrum plasmodium stage in Stephenson and Stempen- pretty good match for the plasmodium shot here.
