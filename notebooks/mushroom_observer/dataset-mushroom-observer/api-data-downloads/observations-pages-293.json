The sequence was derived from a single (reverse) read; the forward read was totally illegible.  The full-length nrITS locus is 674 nucleotides long in this species (ITS1 = 212 bps, 5.8S = 161 bps, ITS2 = 301 bps).  The ITS spacer is preceded by the last 46 characters of nrSSU and followed by the first 16 bps of nrLSU.  There are no ambiguities present.  There is a single point of heterogeneity in the ITS1 sublocus (in a poly-G homopolymer), which required resolution of two haplotypes in the typical \u0026#8220;1-base-offset\u0026#8221; pattern in order to get the first 52 characters of ITS1.  \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e A BLASTn of the full-length ITS sequence gave 13 top hits having pairwise similarity of 97.8-100%, with 88-100% query cover.

Alignment of these sequences in MUSCLE (not shown here) suggests that most likely we\u0026#8217;re dealing with the same phylogenetic entity endemic to North America (NA) and showing, as expected, intraspecific variability in the ITS spacer consisting of a combination of isolated and scattered ambiguities, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) events and gaps due to variable-length homopolymeric repeats; a few mismatches near either terminus can probably be attributed to poor read quality and possible editing errors.

After a manual edit of the forward and reverse reads, the resultant consensus nrDNA sequence is 797 base pairs (bps) long. It consists of the last 46 bps of nrSSU, followed by a full-length nrITS region of 713 bps and then by the first 38 characters of nrLSU. The ITS1 and ITS2 subloci in this species are 236 and 316 nucleotides long, respectively; the 5.8S region sandwiched between the ITS spacers is of the standard conserved length of 161 bps. There are two ambiguities at positions nos. 113 (\u0026#8220;Y\u0026#8221; = C/T) and 417 (\u0026#8220;S\u0026#8221; = C/G).
