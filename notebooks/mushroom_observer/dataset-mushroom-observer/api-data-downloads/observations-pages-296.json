To complicate the matters, these GB sequences unfortunately lack the ITS2 sublocus.  However, despite this latter shortcoming, two important conclusions can be readily drawn at this time: (a) this species has a very stable ITS1 region, not affected by the occasional intraspecific variation present in the mini-satellite motifs within this sublocus, that can act as a reliable genetic barcode and (b) this taxon is not conspecific with any of the known European scaber stalks from sect. \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Scabra\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eScabra\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, for which GenBank accessions derived from properly identified vouchers exist.

While the ITS2 sequence of MO330112 perfectly matches two GenBank accessions derived from the material collected by T.D.

Some of these mushrooms have fairly dark caps, most notably on the disc (and especially when young), and some are more uniformly gray throughout the entire fruiting cycle. As seen in this observation, the dark cap color may fade. The typical \u0026#8220;life span\u0026#8221; of one of these mushrooms appears to be quite short. This one went from button to well past maturity (no spore drop) in little more than 24 hours.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":60701,"consensus_name":"Amanita

Recently, an example suspected to represent luzernensis was collected in Letchworth State Park, NY for which hemlock was listed as a tree found in the vicinity of the mushroom. Regarding the trees nearby this present observation, the spot featured both oak and hemlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpore dimensions for this present observation well match 74501, mainly globose with wide range in diameter, 7-11 microns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked this ridge at least 6 times over the course of this summer.
