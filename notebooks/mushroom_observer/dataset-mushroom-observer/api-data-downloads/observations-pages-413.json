This particular slope is covered with fallen timber and other forestry detritus products, most likely the result of restoration projects. So, there is ample material for saprobic fungi to colonize and feast on senescent plant products. Just beyond the slope lies a deserted apple orchard that has seen better days. It’s possible the close proximity to the obsolete apple orchard has something to do with the diversity of fungi in this woodland area. This fungus was growing gregariously with a few other members of what looked to be the same species.\u003c/p\u003e","Substrate":"\u003cp\u003eMany bryophytes were clustered around the fungus, retaining water, and, in doing so, created a moist microclimate for the fungus. The wood was at an advanced stage in the decomposition process with nondescript features, almost too decayed to identify to species. Bill’s Woods hosts many hardwood species so I’m assuming the tree trunk in question was of the hardwood type. However, members of this genus are also known to favor coniferous substrates, especially if proven to be Gyromitra and not Peziza.\u003c/p\u003e","Location":"\u003cp\u003eThis fungus was spotted in Bill’s Woods at the perimeter of the old apple orchard, a well-known patch of land once dedicated to pome production.\u003c/p\u003e"},"notes":"\u003cp\u003eThe fungus was roughly 3 cm in size and was attached by a single, rudimentary stem to the woody material below.

The cup margin was not completely contiguous, with an invagination-like point at which the ridge turned in towards the center of the cup creating a wrinkled texture.
