Populus deltoides further away, unlikely (IMO) to be a mycorrhizal host but the best candidate if this is mycorrhizal. Interior firm. Odor strong and foul, like a hot outhouse with hints of garlic. I smelled them before I found them. Odor a bit more mild and egg-like when sniffing freshly cut gleba. Rhizomorphs are visible in in situ pictures but these are likely from the Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata growing nearby. No rhizomorphs were noticed attached to the fruiting bodies. Peridium smooth.
