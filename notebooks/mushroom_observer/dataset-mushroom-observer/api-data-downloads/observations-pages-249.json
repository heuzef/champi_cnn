came across this very interesting \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lepidella\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eLepidella\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e while hiking on the Sand Spring Trail (SST) that runs along Hickory Run Brook/Stream.  I have no idea what species it is as I couldn\u0026#8217;t find it on either the PA/NJ or Northeast checklists.  The closest match is \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Acanthophysellum+cinereopannosa\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA. cinereopannosa\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, but I don\u0026#8217;t think it\u0026#8217;s that.  Perhaps Rod can help here. \u003cbr /\u003e\nThe GPS coordinates of the spot are approximate, but the collection site is about 50-60 yards from where SST and its campgrounds branch split off and just before SST enters a thick rhododendron grove.  The actual spot is a steep slope below the right side of SST (between the trail and the creek).  The slope forms the eastern side of this bowl-shaped pit surrounded by mature hemlocks.  A careful inspection of the site revealed a couple of maples, a large birch of some kind (gray bark) and two large black cherry trees near and slightly beyond the hemlocks.  I think the amanita is probably mycorrizal with the hemlocks.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSo why is the amanita in pieces?!  Well, I after collecting the mushroom I stood up on the steep slope, slipped and fell; the amanita fell out of my hand and broke up upon hitting the ground.  I doubt these woods heard so many bilingual profanities in such a short time before \u0026#8211; I was cursing myself for being such a klutz, but then calmed down as s**t just happens.  At least I should be thankful I didn\u0026#8217;t hurt myself falling flat on my belly. :-)\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe pix give a good idea of what this critter looks like.  I estimate it was 6\u0026quot; tall.  The key features of this amanita are the whoolly-cottony grayish-tan universal veil covering the cap, stipe, upper part of the bulb and the underside of the partial veil, and a very large bulb.  The odor was of decaying protein.  The PV still covered the gills, so it was immature at the time of discovery; however, the cap expanded while I drove back home and I was eventually able to get a spore print.  The spores appear small (under 10 microns) and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid when viewed at x400 without a mounting agent \u0026#8212; more on that later.  \u003cbr /\u003e\nThe final cap size is 9 \u0026#215; 7.5 cm; the stipe is 2 cm wide; the bulb is 6.5 cm long, the cross-section is oval, 4.5 \u0026#215; 3.5 cm wide.
