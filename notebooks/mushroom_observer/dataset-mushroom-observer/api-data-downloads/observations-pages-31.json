Aptroot (2003) pointed out that North American material differs at the species level from the European Punctelia subrudecta (as seen, for instance, in amadej\u0026#8217;s fine \u003ca href=\"http://mushroomobserver.org/18596?search_seq=1295458\"\u003eMO observation #18596\u003c/a\u003e), and most of the collections from eastern North America were then referred to Punctelia perreticulata instead. More recently, Lendemer and Hodkinson (2010, in review) carry the analysis further and propose a new species to accommodate this material. MO follows the most recent Esslinger checklist for lichens of North America, so the present observation is assigned to Punctelia perreticulata, at least until the NA checklist picks up its new name, Punctelia caseana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReferences:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.sharnoffphotos.com/lichensF/punctelia_caseana.html\"\u003eSharnoff\u0026#8217;s Punctelia caseana gallery\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://symbiota.org/nalichens/taxa/index.php?taxon=54601\"\u003eCNALH images and locality map\u003c/a\u003e, and a larger, \u003ca href=\"http://symbiota.org/nalichens/collections/maps/googlemap.php?usecookies=false\u0026type=3\u0026db=all\u0026thes=on\u0026taxa=Punctelia%20subrudecta\"\u003einteractive locality map.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nLendemer and Hodkinson.
