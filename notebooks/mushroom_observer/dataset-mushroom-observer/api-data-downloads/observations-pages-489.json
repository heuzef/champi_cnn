far northern NJ during summer and early fall.  Sequencing (ITS) revealed that in addition to what is presumed to be \u003ccite\u003eL. snellii\u003c/cite\u003e (e.g., \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/329898\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 329898\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; possibly \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/288473\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 288473\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) there is another very common taxon possessing essentially the same ITS2 sequence as \u003ccite\u003esnellii\u003c/cite\u003e but a very different ITS1 sequence (e.g., \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/281644\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 281644\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/288622\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 288622\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/330112\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 330112\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/370555\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 370555\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).  It is very likely that the latter entity is a published species, possibly \u003ccite\u003eL. flavostipitatum\u003c/cite\u003e (?).  Since ITS1 is suitable strictly for barcoding in \u003ccite\u003eLeccinum\u003c/cite\u003e and the more conserved ITS2 sublocus is of some basic phylogenetic value for this genus (for grouping species into clades/subclades), I lumped these two taxa into the \u0026#8220;\u003ccite\u003esnellii\u003c/cite\u003e group\u0026#8221;.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMy experience with these summer birch boletes led me to tentatively separating them on the basis of cap morphologies.  \u003ccite\u003eSnellii\u003c/cite\u003e has a darker cap with large patches of much lighter, almost whitish, color, whereas the other species has a lighter brown cap covered with darker appressed fibrils.  As for the staining of the exposed flesh, both species stain both blue and red, mostly when fresh and well-hydrated (e.g., \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/329898\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 329898\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/370555\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 370555\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).  When the flesh is more dry, the onset of colors is delayed and the staining is more erratic and less intense.  In \u0026#8220;cf. \u003ccite\u003eflavostipitatum\u003c/cite\u003e\u0026#8221;, oxidative bluing is often restricted to the very bottom of the stipe, while the upper stipe and cap either don\u0026#8217;t redden at all or barely turn reddish-brown.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAs far as the present collections of 7 fruitbodies is concerned, its is possible it\u0026#8217;s a mixture of both \u003ccite\u003esnellii\u003c/cite\u003e and \u0026#8220;cf. \u003ccite\u003eflavostipitatum\u003c/cite\u003e\u0026#8221;.
