polypore mushroom was found on October 18, 2023 on a dead beech tree alongside the cross country running trails here at the University of Maine. This mushroom has a dark brown, dry, smooth, and silky moderately indented pileus with a rolled margin. The stipe is hard, medium tan in coloration, smooth, and dry. There are no gills but rather pores. The pores are one layer and discolors (lighter tan to cream). This mushroom did not leave a spore print. The pileus is 4-8 cm in diameter. Grows in clusters/groups. The stipe is 2-3 cm in length. Does not bruise. Spores light colored almost transparent.
