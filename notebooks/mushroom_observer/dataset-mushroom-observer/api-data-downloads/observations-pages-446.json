I may update with tree name later).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mushroom started out as some kind of ball, because once it \u0026#8220;breaks\u0026#8221;, there\u0026#8217;s a volva underneath. The size of the ball, cap and volva is huge though, 3-4 inches across. The volva itself is a big blob of \u0026#8220;mushroom material\u0026#8221;, which is all white throughout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stipe is 3/4 to 1 inch thick, although one (old) specimen I see has a thinner (1/2 inch) and longer (5 inch) stipe. Maybe it gets thinner in old age? The skin of stipe is not smooth, it has these fiber strands as if it\u0026#8217;s shedding (similar to how a eucalyptus shed its bark).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fresh mushroom is white all-around, with dirt attaching to the top of cap. If I cut the stipe, it has somewhat off-white color, turning to rust in old age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever if I cut the cap, the color is dark maroon. In fact, the white outer layer on the cap is very thin, just like a skin. Underneath all that is a dark rusty/maroony color, even on young/fresh mushrooms. It looks very thick and dense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oddest thing on this mushroom is the lack of gill or pores. I cannot find anything like that on the underneath of the cap. It looks like a membrane or continuous skin. It\u0026#8217;s like that even for old and mature mushrooms. I know it doesn\u0026#8217;t make sense (how/where does it release spores?) but that\u0026#8217;s what it looks like. I\u0026#8217;ll enclose a close-up of the underneath of 2 of them (one fresh and one mature). The cap is fully developed for both of them, yet I can find no sign of gill or open-mouth pores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell is not like your typical mushroom. It\u0026#8217;s somewhat musty, and I would say exotic (I know this is vague), but not unpleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can it be?

Under the microscope, I noticed some subtle differences between the 2 apothecia that made me wonder if it is possibly 2 different species?  Perhaps the apothecia were just of different age or something, which caused these apparent differences?  What I saw, or interpreted, was the following (I will call the apothecia #1 and #2):  1.) one of the apothecia had paraphyses with visible (and prominent) septa [#1], while the other did not.  2.) the asci in one apothecia appeared truncated at the tip [#1], while the other\u0026#8217;s asci were rounded.  3.)  While the spores were roughly the same size/shape, there were cosmetic differences between them (obviously, this could just be due to age).  4.)
