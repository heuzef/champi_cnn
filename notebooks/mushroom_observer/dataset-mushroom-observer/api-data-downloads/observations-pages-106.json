At this moment, without the possibility of scoping it, I cannot go very far on the identification of the species. It is also clear, due to the chemistry, that it cannot be \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Acarospora+schleicheri\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA. schleicheri\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, my initial guess. On the other hand, the British Flora does not help, since the only species therein with C- and K+ red on thallus are \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Acarospora+smaragdula\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA. smaragdula\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Acarospora+subrufula\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA. subrufula\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, whose features do not match.

Comparative to my specimens, this species has big squamules (convoluted lobes?) at the centre ending by relatively wide lobes at the margin (resembling a \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Squamarina\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eSquamarina\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e as is mentioned at the site) while my specimens became more areolate at the centre with small lobes at the margin. Another common feature is the color of thallus, varying from shining green (when humid) to almost white (when drying). At that site it is mentioned that such species is found on soil with gypsum, that I don\u0026#8217;t saw at this location, but all the rock here are of calcareous origin and the existence of gypsum is known for this big location.
