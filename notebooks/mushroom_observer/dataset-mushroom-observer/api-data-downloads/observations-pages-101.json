I would estimate size at 25mm x 18mm. Peridium has dried to mostly black with dark brown highlights, knobbly, no indications of the rhizomorphs present on the fresh specimen (see MO obs. 117317). Gleba sepia to light brown with olivaceous highlights, but also with black to brownish-black areas; loculate, locules less than .2mm across, scattered.

pileus diameter 4.5-8(10) cm, fruitbodies 5.5-8 cm tall; pileus distinctly sticky to slimy; stipe distinctly bulbous but not marginate;  SP abundant, rusty-brown (oac686); viola-blue color fades with time in refrigerator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree alternative determinations with similar appearance among phlegmaciums have been considered: C. sodagnitus, C. caerulescens and C. caesiocanescens. C. sodagineus seems to be ruled out because of its distinctly marginate bulb and somewhat smaller spores (Ref.: (4) 8-10,5/5-6 μ). Also filamentous cortina when young seems rather white, not lilac. It could easily be ruled out by blood red KOH reaction of pileus cuticle. Unfortunately, I didn\u0026#8217;t make this test. C. caerulescens seems closer to my observation. Its spores correspond to the measured ones. Yet it also has a distinct up to 4.5 cm diameter (Ref.:(4)) marginate bulb and bluish edged gills. Both were not the case with my observation. C. caesiocanescens has smaller spores (8-10/5-5.5 μ Ref.:(4)) and grows under conifers, so it is most probably out. With respect to the stipe bulb my pictures may deceive a bit because of perspective. Bulbs were not so large as they may appear from pictures and had no rim. A picture of cross-section would make this clear, but I didn’t make it. If C. cumatilis s.lat. is correct decision then it is C. cumatilis var. haassii because of habitat (broad leaved trees) and clearly violet lamellae even when young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon
