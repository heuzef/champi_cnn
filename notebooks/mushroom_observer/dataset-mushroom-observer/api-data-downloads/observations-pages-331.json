The specimen pictured on book\u0026#8217;s front cover seemed to me miraculous, from \u0026#8216;tropical\u0026#8217; character and obviously rare. I have had little hope once to find it. Actually, Teloschistes chrysophthalmus is a widely scattered lichen present on north and south earth hemisphere (except in Asia and Antarctica) but in very localized areas and indeed rare at least in Europe. Literature states: \u0026#8220;… very rare …\u0026#8221; in England (Ref.:1), \u0026#8220;… now (2005) probably already extinct from Britain…\u0026#8221; (Ref.4): \u0026#8220;…  not documented from Check Republic…\u0026#8221; (Ref.6), \u0026#8220;…extremely rare…\u0026#8221; in Italy (Ref.:9); \u0026#8220;…extinct from Germany, Baden-Württemberg already at the beginning of 19. century…\u0026#8221; (Ref.: 3). The species have been eliminated over many former places by habitat destruction and air pollution. But, on some places it is recently recolonizing its former distribution areas, like in south England (Ref.:12).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently there is no records of Teloschistes chrysophthalmus in the Boletus Informaticus Database for Slovenia (Ref.: 5).  But, Ref.:11. states its presence in subalpine and Dinaric phytogeographical regions of the country. Records from Sub-Mediterranean region of Croatia along Adriatic Sea shore also exist (Ref. 8. – substratum Spartium junceus and Ref. 9. – substratum Quercus pubescens). However, a relatively recent lichen survey of the island Krk does not list this species (Ref.: 10). The closest find seems to be a single, more than hundred years old find in Kvarner bay littoral region next to the island Krk (Ref.:13). Eventually these pictures show the first documented observation of this species on the island Krk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe find was, at the first moment, a small disappointment for me. Lichen tufts in dry state were quite inconspicuous, of muddy orange brown color and much, much smaller than their picture in my mind (based on Sharnoff\u0026#8217;s beautiful macro picture). However, when looked through hand lens and in moist state they unfold their beauty incredibly. The bushy tufts were many, on many bushes along the narrow trail through macchia, altogether more than 100 individuals. They were mostly about 1 cm in diameter and 5-10 mm high, many were smaller and only some up to 2 cm across. All of them strictly inhabited small, dead or alive branches and twigs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamera: Nikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Sony ILCE6000 / Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar E 16-70 mm/f4\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":6616,"consensus_name":"Teloschistes chrysophthalmus","location_id":20423,"location_name":"Krk island, north Adriatic Sea, Kvarner archipelago, Croatia","primary_image_id":1034321},{"id":366663,"type":"observation","date":"2019-05-05","latitude":"29.5523","longitude":"-98.2814","altitude":213,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.827539,"created_at":"2019-05-16T10:39:45.000Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T14:25:18.000Z","number_of_views":25,"last_viewed":"2023-09-08T00:26:30.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOddly cool little mushroom with a cap and stem, but the underside looked more like pores than gills.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt also appears to have tiny spikes or hairs on the top of the cap. \u003cbr /\u003e\nThere is a hiking pole in some photos for scale. \u003cbr /\u003e\nAttempted to get a sporeprint, but nothing visible on the white paper.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":9758,"consensus_id":51283,"consensus_name":"Lentinus arcularius","location_id":6309,"location_name":"Earth","primary_image_id":1034334},{"id":366664,"type":"observation","date":"2019-05-05","latitude":"29.5523","longitude":"-98.2814","altitude":213,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.827539,"created_at":"2019-05-16T10:53:57.000Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T14:16:57.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2023-08-20T00:19:43.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eTan cap with very white underside/gills.

But there\u0026#8217;s two easy ways to tell it from arvensis.  First is the giant spores in crocodilinus (up to 14 um) scattered among smaller ones.  They don\u0026#8217;t even have to be measured to see that they are huge.  After examining many collections here I stopped because every one was crocodilinus.  I used to find arvensis a lot in Santa Cruz but it disappeared from that area in the early 1990s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second way is by the staining.  In most collections of crocodilinus the flesh will stain orangish and then reddish at least when young in the stem.  The process can take minutes or hours depending on temperature and moisture.  I have never seen arvensis do that.  The reddening is also mentioned in many European texts for macrosporus, a synonym of crocodilinus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first photo attached is of the mushrooms you sequenced.

The bark does not seem especially “fresh”, though the median looks like it is maintained with mulch annually. I suspect the mulch is chipping from a local arborist (mulch seems to be comprised predominantly of deciduous hard woods). The median is exposed and completely free of herbaceous plants and weeds. The largest planting on the median is a young small-medium sized western red cedar tree; it provides little to no canopy cover or shade. There are a handful of other coniferous sapling plantings dispersed sparsely along the length of the median; these saplings have little to no foliage and provide no shade from the sun. The fungi are fruiting prolifically in clusters along the entire median (median is approximately 200ft long by 15ft wide). The fungi do not seem to be concentrating around the bases of any specific trees. From what I can tell all of the fungi on the median seem to be the same species.
