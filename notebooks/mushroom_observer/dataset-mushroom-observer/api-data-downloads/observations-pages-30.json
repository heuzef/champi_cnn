Wetmore (1976) reports appalachensis from Boot Canyon, Emory Peak, and the East Rim. For leucomela, he  cites only specimens from the South Rim trail collected by Anderson and Shushan (but note that Wetmore\u0026#8217;s key requires leucomela to be non-sorediate, which is not at all the case according to Brodo and Lendemer).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash, (vol. 1, pp.207-219) makes similar remarks about the color of the thallus undersurface in these two species and then mentions an additional character:\u003cbr /\u003e\nappalachensis (soredia in soralia on the underside of the lobe tips, bending the tips upwards and thus appearing labriform)\u003cbr /\u003e\nleucomela (lobe tips flat, soralia more diffuse on lower surface).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this score, the choice is clear: these photos match Nash\u0026#8217;s description of
