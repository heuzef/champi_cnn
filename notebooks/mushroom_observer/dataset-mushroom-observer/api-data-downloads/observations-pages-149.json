The next best alternative is a lateral view with the apiculus down, which can only be assessed once the true spore shape is recognized.  This unfortunately eliminates the randomness of measurements.

Boletus luridus is very colorful, meaning more many colored than of one or two saturated uniform colors. One can find all kinds of shade of red, blue and green (when bruised), yellow, ocher, brown, black and who knows which else color. Having very characteristic red net on its stipe, it is usually easy to determine it correctly. Rapidly and drastically changing color on all its parts when handled also helps.
