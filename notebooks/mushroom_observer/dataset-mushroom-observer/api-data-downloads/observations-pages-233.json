They grow on my property in Northern California  in the mixed forest under oak and madrone trees  ( in leaves).  Mushrooms are very clean and have no bad odor.    And they do not stain any color when cut or bruised.  Tops are firm and sort of thick and almost look edible.  They are also not perfectly round. The tops are not slimy or sticky.  They are sort of dry and have velvet feel to them.  Tops are light reddish brown color, sort of like dark tan.   There are no skirts , scales or other strange looking grows on them.  Very  clean White color gills  and steam.    Gilss are tight together and close to the stem.  Steam is not very dense, but also not very   soft either. Spore print is white on black and also on  white paper.   They measure aprox.

Fries (gray spore mass and fragile threads) and determine it as Lycogala terrestre Fries. (Ref.: 1 and 5). However, not all authors recognize both taxa. Some consider Lycogala terrestre as variety of Lycogala epidendrum, some synonimyze them (Ref.4). What surprises with this find is unusual surface of spores. Almost all sources state minutely reticulated spores for both Lycogala epidendrum and Lycogala terrestre, while the spores observed show quite coarse reticulation. Also aethalia show both, almost smooth, minutely spinulose, as well as coarsely, transversally wrinkled surface of pseudocapillitium threads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout 12-13 aethalia found. Average diameter 6.7 mm, SD = 1.7 mm (min = 3.5 mm, max = 9.2 mm). Peridium thin but strong, flexible.
