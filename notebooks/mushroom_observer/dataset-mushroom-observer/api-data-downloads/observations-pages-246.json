Also there were many gnawed away with beetles present (in some photos) that I\u0026#8217;ve found in previous years around G. tsugae at this time.  Another thing is that I only seem to find it growing on trees which are clearly dead and often broken entirely through the trunk.  I\u0026#8217;ve seen it listed as a parasite and saprophyte on conifers, but only found it on trees nowhere near alive.  For evidence I took pictures of the each tree to show it\u0026#8217;s condition.  All have empty branches and some are even broken in half at the trunk.  Note I also have a picture of the inside of a few showing \u0026#8220;growth rings\u0026#8221; as though it grew in stages as well as a picture of a large shelf cut in half.  The area just behind the pore bearing surface is brown and almost looks like gills whereas the rest of the flesh is white.  Also I found a set which was clearly left to age yet wasn\u0026#8217;t nibbled away by beetles.  Perhaps it was from a previous year?
