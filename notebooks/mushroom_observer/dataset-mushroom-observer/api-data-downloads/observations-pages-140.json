my identification is correct this is another of our rare lichens. Let me start these notes giving some of its macro features:\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Growing on a piece of compactified soil (it looks like rock but disintegrates when touched) in a fence, sharing the space with another interesting lichen:\u003cbr /\u003e\n- The thallus is grey, pruinose, and well delimitated by a yellow-brown prothallus-like zone;\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Apothecia dark colored (black), up to 1.2 mm in diameter, licedeine, adnate, hollow inside.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWith these features it could belong to many genera. However, the micro features permit to go further in the identification. Here are some:\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Hymenium with ~180 um high; Hypothecium red-brown: Epithecium dark-colored with some blue-green tinge;\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Paraphyses branched and anastomosing, seeming conglutinate; \u003cbr /\u003e\n- Asci saccate with 8 spores each;\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Spores muriform, with many cells, hialine when young and becoming light colored at maturity, for which I obtained the following average measures: Me = 29.3 \u0026#215; 12.9 um ; Qe = 2.3 (N=32).\u003cbr /\u003e\nUsing the key in the British Flora (Reference 1 below) devoted to \u003cbr /\u003e\nCrustose Lichens: apothecia rounded; photobiont chlorococoid; ascospores colourless, septate (key 6c) \u003cbr /\u003e\nI came to the name \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Schadonia+fecunda\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eSchadonia fecunda\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. It concerns a rare lichen in the Bristish Islands. However the dimensions of the spores given there ((30-)40-50(-60)) are a bit different from my specimen. Then I looked in the internet for more information and first found a page reporting the existence of that species in Finland. Next I found Reference 2, which is available in Google books. There I could saw that there exist two species (with descriptions) with an ARTIC? distribution: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Schadonia+alpina\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eS. alpina\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Greeland, Scandinavia, Siberia, and USA) and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Schadonia+fecunda\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eS. fecunda\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Greenland, European Alps and British Columbia in N.

For both species the dimensions of the spores are similar to those of my specimen: 22-41 \u0026#215; 9-15 um for \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Schadonia+alpina\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eS. alpina\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and 22-40 \u0026#215; 10-18 um for \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Schadonia+fecunda\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eS. fecunda\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. The main difference between them is the number of spores per ascum: 2-4 for \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Schadonia+alpina\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eS. alpina\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and 8 for \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Schadonia+fecunda\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eS. fecunda\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.  So, maybe the specimens collected in the British Islands have distinct spores dimension than the collected elsewhere.\u003cbr /\u003e\nTherefore, I believe that my specimen belongs to the species \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Schadonia+fecunda\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eS. fecunda\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and not even the fact that I¬¥m so far from the known existing places (almost 20 years ago)  makes me doubt (I quote from Ref. 2: \u0026#8220;It probably occurs more widely but is very inconspicuous\u0026#8221; and note that this species is in the checklist of Spain, our neighbour country).\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2250,"consensus_id":13750,"consensus_name":"Schadonia fecunda","location_id":1063,"location_name":"Planalto das Cezaredas, Portugal","primary_image_id":418884},{"id":164728,"type":"observation","date":"2014-04-27","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.7019,"created_at":"2014-05-05T22:24:09.000Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T22:24:13.000Z","number_of_views":26,"last_viewed":"2023-08-25T20:06:10.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eYellow with brown apothecia.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4649,"consensus_id":5991,"consensus_name":"Lecanora","location_id":6762,"location_name":"Braga, Portugal","primary_image_id":418895},{"id":164729,"type":"observation","date":"2014-04-27","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70191,"created_at":"2014-05-05T22:25:33.000Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T22:25:40.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2023-08-05T20:31:46.000Z","owner_id":4649,"consensus_id":5645,"consensus_name":"Lichen","location_id":6762,"location_name":"Braga, Portugal","primary_image_id":418897},{"id":164730,"type":"observation","date":"2014-04-27","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70191,"created_at":"2014-05-05T22:27:54.000Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T22:44:00.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2023-08-22T08:27:36.000Z","owner_id":4649,"consensus_id":5645,"consensus_name":"Lichen","location_id":6762,"location_name":"Braga, Portugal","primary_image_id":418898},{"id":164732,"type":"observation","date":"2014-05-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.50452,"created_at":"2014-05-06T00:49:22.000Z","updated_at":"2014-05-06T00:49:24.000Z","number_of_views":51,"last_viewed":"2023-10-29T04:58:04.000Z","owner_id":1411,"consensus_id":44007,"consensus_name":"Arachnopeziza aurata","location_id":357,"location_name":"Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":418899},{"id":164738,"type":"observation","date":"2014-05-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.54042,"created_at":"2014-05-06T02:37:47.000Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T23:02:44.000Z","number_of_views":30,"last_viewed":"2023-08-19T22:38:58.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFruiting abundantly just below snowmelt.

This can be achieved using Key 3 of British Flora (Ref. 1).\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe first one of them can  be immediately excluded, since the species in this genus are associated with free algae and are gelatinous.

It can be found on dry, stony, deteriorating, long time ago abandoned pastures. Its main characteristics are rich, filigree branching and lack of tendency to one-sidedly oriented terminal branches with sharp apices (to the contrast to several other similar species where the branches\u0026#8217; tips are more or less oriented in the same direction). Growing was growing in several, mostly round patches in the vicinity. Round clumps measured up to 20 cm (8\u0026quot;) in diameter and had about 5 cm (2\u0026quot;) thicknesses. The largest \u0026#8216;continuous\u0026#8217; mat found measured about 1 \u0026#215; 0.6 m (3 \u0026#215; 2 feet). Photographed species were in almost dry state.

after several observations of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyxine\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePyxine\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e specimens one fertile appeared. This fact, together with the macro features and the yellow medulla permits immediately to indicate the species: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyxine+subcinerea\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. subcinerea\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Such conclusion can be derived from the key for the genus in the Sonoran Flora (Ref. 1) , taking also into account that it was the only fertile species accepted to appear in Europe according to Ref. 2 (of which I could only read the abstract) as of 1983. Let me also refer that \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyxine+subcinerea\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. subcinerea\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is the unique of the genus appearing in the Portuguese checklist and that, according to recent records (already in this century) in the Azores Islands there are other three species: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyxine+coccoes\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. coccoes\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyxine+farinosa\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. farinosa\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyxine+sorediata\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. sorediata\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, where only the first one can be fertile (see Ref. 3).\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn Ref. 3 one can also find photos of herbarium specimens of the two fertile species and the microscopy of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyxine+coccoes\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. coccoes\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. The comparison of the more detailed photos with that of my specimen seems a perfect match for \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyxine+subcinerea\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. subcinerea\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, while \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyxine+coccoes\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. coccoes\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is much less sorediate and do not have visible pycnidia.\u003cbr /\u003e\nTaking the oportunity of having collected a sample I also made the microscopic analysis which, as far as I can see, reinforces the previous data. However, I observed with surprise that the spores are not so easy to describe as one can infer from the descriptions available in Ref. 1 (and also in Ref. 4): In fact, though most of the spores are 1-septate, the are other with no septum at all and others  2-3-septate, sometimes one septum being more \u0026#8220;clear\u0026#8221; than the others; also though most of them being ellipsoid there are others ovoid and of other forms; moreover, some of the spores have terminal apices lighter than the brown base colour and the tissues at the apices seem to be weaker than the rest of the spores, since appeared broken in the photos.

So it was a surprise that when looking at the spores they appear to be muriform. But I was so \u0026#8220;convinced\u0026#8221; of it to be a \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyrenula\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePyrenula\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e that I search in the British Flora for species in that genus with muriform spores. Well, that even exist (just one), but it is rare and the spores are a lot bigger. Then I realise that in the microscopic observation I didn¬¥t saw any alger layer. This point make me remind that I had observed in the past a pyrenocarpus with muriform spores: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Julella+vitrispora\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eJulella vitrispora\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.
