I should have tried for better photos in the field, but they were pretty much all dried out a ugly.  Lots of burnt ground, since the forest burned down a year before.  I believe people said there was 2in of rain the weekend before, but then 100 deg. and dry since then.  Although only 80 deg. at the campsite here, it was 8000 ft. in elevation.  So a large flush of these, that were all dried out.  Sorry about the shot back home, the posed shot is really ugly, but that is what was left after a whole day in the car at 100deg.
