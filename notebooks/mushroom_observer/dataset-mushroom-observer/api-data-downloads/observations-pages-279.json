According to Ogris (2018) Ref.: 6 there are only three UTM squares known in the country where it has been found and registered. None of these finds lay in Alpine phytogeographical region of the country. However, GBIF- Austria, Ref.: 8 states a find in Bavščica valley, which is in Alpine region and not far from this observation. The lichen is also rare in the region directly west of Posočje in NE Italy Ref.: 5 and also in Germany (Ref.: 7 and Ref.:1). It is interesting that this species appears more and more frequent during last few decades according to Ref.:1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlavopunctelia flaventior can be recognized by slightly wrinkled upper surface od lobes with white, faintly reticulated pseudocyphellae and numerous, laminal and marginal soralia. Lower surface is dark in the thallus center with dark, short, simple rhizines and much lighter in color and without rhizines at the thallus margins. Only two specimens have been found on this tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":6558,"consensus_name":"Flavopunctelia flaventior","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":859926},{"id":313349,"type":"observation","date":"2018-02-02","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.85111,"created_at":"2018-03-29T23:08:27.000Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T05:02:36.000Z","number_of_views":702,"last_viewed":"2024-04-19T09:54:33.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOriginally posted on \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SocieteMycologiqueDeNouvelleCaledonie/posts/2029068724041238\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":181,"consensus_id":63321,"consensus_name":"Myriodiscus","location_id":17556,"location_name":"New Caledonia, France","primary_image_id":859934},{"id":313350,"type":"observation","date":"2018-03-28","latitude":"43.0513","longitude":"-89.8103","altitude":292,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.53302,"created_at":"2018-03-29T23:14:13.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T23:43:55.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2021-09-30T13:54:01.000Z","owner_id":12025,"consensus_id":6567,"consensus_name":"Xanthomendoza hasseana","location_id":13471,"location_name":"Parrish Oak Savanna State Natural Area, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":859939},{"id":313351,"type":"observation","date":"2018-03-28","latitude":"43.0511","longitude":"-89.8105","altitude":300,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.84434,"created_at":"2018-03-29T23:28:26.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T23:43:24.000Z","number_of_views":25,"last_viewed":"2023-10-07T07:37:52.000Z","owner_id":12025,"consensus_id":6455,"consensus_name":"Lecidea","location_id":13471,"location_name":"Parrish Oak Savanna State Natural Area, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":859940},{"id":313352,"type":"observation","date":"2018-03-28","latitude":"43.0129","longitude":"-89.7285","altitude":0,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.823328,"created_at":"2018-03-29T23:30:42.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T23:30:45.000Z","number_of_views":16,"last_viewed":"2023-08-20T08:00:25.000Z","owner_id":12025,"consensus_id":6146,"consensus_name":"Dermatocarpon","location_id":13471,"location_name":"Parrish Oak Savanna State Natural Area, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":859941},{"id":313353,"type":"observation","date":"2018-03-28","latitude":"43.0512","longitude":"-89.8104","altitude":279,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.81967,"created_at":"2018-03-29T23:40:22.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T17:11:01.000Z","number_of_views":38,"last_viewed":"2021-09-30T13:53:35.000Z","owner_id":12025,"consensus_id":5645,"consensus_name":"Lichen","location_id":13471,"location_name":"Parrish Oak Savanna State Natural Area, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":859942},{"id":313354,"type":"observation","date":"2018-03-28","latitude":"45.6111","longitude":"-122.7124","altitude":24,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.56219,"created_at":"2018-03-29T23:47:22.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T23:47:25.000Z","number_of_views":24,"last_viewed":"2021-12-09T07:45:48.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFruiting gregariously at the edge of a black cottonwood forest.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":11952,"consensus_id":207,"consensus_name":"Laccaria laccata","location_id":13231,"location_name":"Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, Portland, Multnomah Co., Oregon, USA","primary_image_id":859946},{"id":313355,"type":"observation","date":"2018-03-28","latitude":"43.0511","longitude":"-89.8103","altitude":299,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.39891,"created_at":"2018-03-29T23:48:55.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T23:59:53.000Z","number_of_views":17,"last_viewed":"2024-02-05T09:58:29.000Z","owner_id":12025,"consensus_id":6028,"consensus_name":"Candelariella","location_id":13471,"location_name":"Parrish Oak Savanna State Natural Area, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":859949},{"id":313356,"type":"observation","date":"2018-03-29","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.828954,"created_at":"2018-03-29T23:52:04.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T01:51:33.000Z","number_of_views":34,"last_viewed":"2023-10-05T20:50:44.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing in leaf litter near trunk of live oak.

The genus is an unmistakable one once found and handled in-person.  The upper, fertile surface is incredibly smooth and rather cool to the touch.  It is the \u0026#8220;ceiling\u0026#8221; of a structure which houses (and occasionally eats) the scale insects sucking away at the tree underneath.  In between are \u0026#8220;pillars\u0026#8221; of ropy tendrils which keep the fertile surface elevated.  The space between makes for a kind of firm-pillowy consistency when pressed.  The alternatingly sheltered/devoured insects should have been easier to locate, but I\u0026#8217;m not convinced I saw any anytime from the field to the dissecting scope.  The collection was split in three, with culturing and sequencing performed in Gainesville on a trip to the Smith Lab.

bright colored thallus. However, genus Caloplaca includes many species and several have yellow thallus and apothecia. Looking at spores seems necessary for a reliable determination. Mature, released spores have not been found. Instead those released by pressure during preparation of hymenium squash are shown and measured. Their dimensions fit to expectations, but they were of much variable internal structure. Most of them were 4-loculate, some of them also with for Caloplaca ochracea typical narrow channel-like loculi between both terminal ones. Asci were 4-spored, which fits to Caloplaca ochracea.
