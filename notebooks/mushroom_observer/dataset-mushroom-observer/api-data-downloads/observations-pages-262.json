I was unable to assign this find to one of them. Following the key of Section 6 of Lactarius (Ref.: 2, p383) this find should be Lactarius blennius var. blennius based on piled dimension (3 \u0026#8211; 7 cm for var. blennius contrary to 5 \u0026#8211; 12 cm for var. fluens) or Lactarius blennius var. fluens based on strong production of milk (even in quite dry state!). Also variable hut color speaks for this variety. On the other hand, the absence of lighter, almost whitish hut edge speaks in favor of the first option. The only reliable microscopic trait (Ref.:8) \u0026#8211; thickness of ixocutis \u0026#8211; has not be used because of quite dry fruitbodies. Also, if one reads the description of both varieties in Ref. 9 the text is almost identical and the associated drawings definitely are such.
