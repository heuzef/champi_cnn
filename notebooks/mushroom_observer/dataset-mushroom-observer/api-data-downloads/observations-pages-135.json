Far the most common is G. odoratum. It is one of the most frequent Polypores in my region. Number of my observations goes in several ten. G. separium follows, while both others are much, much rarer. This observation is my first find of G. abietinum, while I haven\u0026#8217;t yet found G. trabeum. Literature states G. abietinum to be rare or very rare in Britain and Europe in general, while Ref.:(3) states it is common in CH. Rivarden and Bernicchia say it is a perennial species, while Breitenbach and Krieglsteiner consider it as an annual species. Also there are two writings of genus name in use \u0026#8211;  Gloeophyllum and Gloephyllum.
