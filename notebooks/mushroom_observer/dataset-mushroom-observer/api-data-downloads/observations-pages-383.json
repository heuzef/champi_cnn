unexpected specimen was collected from packed soil after a recent rain shower.  High temperatures have been near 100F for several days.  The nearest woody vegetation was a mature Honey Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa).  Three or four other similar mushrooms were scattered around at least four feet apart.  This was the only mature example.  It is in the genus Agaricus and probably in the section Arvenses. The cap measured 3.5cm in diameter and the stipe was 3.0 cm long.  The color of the cap and stipe were both off white,  The cap was convex with a smooth margin. Gills were dark brown. The stipe was 0.5 cm in diameter and more or less uniform from apex to base.  The remnant of a ring was noted.  The odor was mild and much like A. bisporus.
