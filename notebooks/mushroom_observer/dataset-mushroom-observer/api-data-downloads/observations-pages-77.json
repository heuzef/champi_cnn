The main reason for that choice was that I interpreted as asci with very many spores those that (seems now) to be big mural spores. This changes the thing completely. In particular, it rules out \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Biatoridium\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eBiatoridium\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e an opens new perspectives for the classification. As I mentioned in the first of those observations, when I saw it for the first, it reminds me of a \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pertusaria\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePertusaria\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. But there is another \u0026#8220;close\u0026#8221; genus: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Phlyctis\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhlyctis\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and, particularly, a species that fits all the details: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Phlyctis+agelaea\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhlyctis agelaea\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. In fact, this species contrary to the most commom \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Phlyctis+argena\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP argena\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is usually fertile, though with half-hidden apothecia, has big mural spores and its chemical reactions are those of my specimens. Therefore, I (now) believe that all these specimens belong to this species. At the end, it was a question of pressure on the cover-slit \u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2250,"consensus_id":12568,"consensus_name":"Phlyctis agelaea","location_id":1063,"location_name":"Planalto das Cezaredas, Portugal","primary_image_id":216105},{"id":93690,"type":"observation","date":"2012-03-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.21499,"created_at":"2012-05-01T21:02:19.000Z","updated_at":"2012-05-02T16:40:36.000Z","number_of_views":48,"last_viewed":"2024-01-19T12:27:51.000Z","owner_id":3160,"consensus_id":297,"consensus_name":"Coprinopsis","location_id":4379,"location_name":"Santa Rita, La Chorrera District, Panama Province, Panama","primary_image_id":216114},{"id":93691,"type":"observation","date":"2012-03-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.904437,"created_at":"2012-05-01T21:04:21.000Z","updated_at":"2012-05-02T09:18:52.000Z","number_of_views":52,"last_viewed":"2024-04-19T07:35:34.000Z","owner_id":3160,"consensus_id":1135,"consensus_name":"Simocybe","location_id":4379,"location_name":"Santa Rita, La Chorrera District, Panama Province, Panama","primary_image_id":216117},{"id":93692,"type":"observation","date":"2012-03-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.72372,"created_at":"2012-05-01T21:09:53.000Z","updated_at":"2018-01-01T21:19:40.000Z","number_of_views":269,"last_viewed":"2024-04-10T07:38:13.000Z","owner_id":3160,"consensus_id":44912,"consensus_name":"Limacella \"sp-L-PAN01\"","location_id":4379,"location_name":"Santa Rita, La Chorrera District, Panama Province, Panama","primary_image_id":216121},{"id":93694,"type":"observation","date":"2012-03-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.80887,"created_at":"2012-05-01T21:16:42.000Z","updated_at":"2012-05-02T09:19:42.000Z","number_of_views":29,"last_viewed":"2024-04-17T15:46:16.000Z","owner_id":3160,"consensus_id":832,"consensus_name":"Marasmius","location_id":4379,"location_name":"Santa Rita, La Chorrera District, Panama Province, Panama","primary_image_id":216129},{"id":93695,"type":"observation","date":"2012-03-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.53247,"created_at":"2012-05-01T21:19:51.000Z","updated_at":"2018-10-29T11:58:20.000Z","number_of_views":38,"last_viewed":"2023-12-29T08:12:33.000Z","owner_id":3160,"consensus_id":60416,"consensus_name":"Oudemansiella sect.
