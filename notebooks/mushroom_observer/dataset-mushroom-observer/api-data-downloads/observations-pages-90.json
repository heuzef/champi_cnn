(This observation is the most recent and larger of the two specimens collected.)  Second observation is posted separately but noted here to indicate that unusual local conditions must have been favorable for this fruiting \u0026#8212; I have never found this mushroom before during 7 years of very local collecting.  Unusual weather comments:  Hot early spring (lousy morel season), some rain end of June, dry very hot summer in early July for about 10 days, more normal rainfall in August. Everything seemed advanced about 2 weeks in appearance this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth specimens were found on well-decayed log of indeterminate species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBright orange soft pore surface, dull orange brown (maybe \u0026#8220;golden\u0026#8221;) irregular lumpy pileus (not glabrous).  Color and shape somewhat like a Pycnoporus but much larger, pores much larger. Firm but not conk-like.  This specimen was 12\u0026#8243; \u0026#215; 15\u0026#8243; \u0026#215; 3\u0026#8243; thick.  Odor not notable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKOH on pileus, pores and context produce, over about a minute, a persistent purplish reaction.  See photos of this and the related observation.  On the pileus, I might call it reddish purple, but it seems more lilac on the context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not initially identify this mushroom, but after a couple of suggestions on MO (thank you), I researched more online, and believe this is probably what is being called a Hapalopilus croceus (and perhaps several other names  \u0026#8211; see below).  However, inconsistently, this specimen is nearly twice the size of the indicated range of size at 20 cm. wide  This specimen was about 38 cm by 30 cm across, and 7.5 cm thick at the center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHapalopilus genus identification had been suggested to me by one of our club\u0026#8217;s identifiers, noting that Noah Siegel had found a specimen in his recent visit to our club in early August.  But it was not in any of my guides and the photo at \u003ca href=\"http://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name/19373\"\u003ehttp://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name/19373\u003c/a\u003e did not look similar.  MO also comments under look-alikes for H. nidulans:  \u0026#8220;Hapalopilus croceus is much larger, up to 20.5 cm wide. It has a reddish orange pore surface but stains bright red in KOH, not purple.\u0026#8221;  [I would not call my stain reactions bright red at all.] Nor did it look like the photo at \u003ca href=\"http://www.illinoismushrooms.com/Hapalopilus%20croceus.html\"\u003ehttp://www.illinoismushrooms.com/Hapalopilus%20croceus.html\u003c/a\u003e.

It helpfully explains: \u0026quot;Hapalopilus means \u0026#8220;with a soft, tender pileus or cap\u0026#8221;; croceus means \u0026#8220;saffron yellow\u0026#8221; although specimens are bright orange when fresh.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee \u003ca href=\"http://data.nbn.org.uk/speciesInfo/taxonomy.jsp?searchTerm=Hapalopilus\u0026amp;spKey=BMSSYS0000020526\"\u003ehttp://data.nbn.org.uk/...\u003c/a\u003e for indication that Hapalopilus croceus is a \u0026#8220;badly formed name\u0026#8221; and that another synonym is Boletus croceus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso see \u003ca href=\"http://ar.mycobank.org/BioloMICS.aspx?Link=T\u0026amp;TableKey=14682616000000067\u0026amp;Rec=28281\u0026amp;Fields=All\"\u003ehttp://ar.mycobank.org/...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, it appears there is some naming confusion here and I am giving up for the time being.
