G. polychromum appears to be rare having been documented here once on willow and it has thin varnish that wears off in age. This looks to me to be either G. sessile or G. lucidum sensu stricto since it occurred on a tree that was introduced from Europe. Both share the buff flesh with concentric growth zones that this obs has. Interestingly G. lucidum almost always has a stem and it long relative to the cap diameter while G. sessile rarely has a stem and when it does it is short and thin. I think this may be G. lucidum.

They were growing beneath a log on the south-facing slope of the wash. There was a stream ~20 feet away. 59 degrees out, sunny, around noon. Elevation ~8,800 feet. Other foragers in my area claim that this species is picky about elevation. Despite three hours of hiking on/off trail and crossing similar/identical habitats, and going up to ~9,200 feet and down to ~8,000, I could never find another one. I did observe someone else searching the fringes of a meadow around ~9,000 feet with ponderosa pine, aspen, gambel oak, and white fir trees. It\u0026#8217;s either very early season, or this area is atypical or on the edge of its preferred distribution. Someone I spoke with claimed that the Ski basin is their lower limit. This same species grows as low as ~7,000 feet in nearby mountains, and would ostensibly grow lower if that environment could support the trees that it associates with. Unfortunately the forest service has diligently removed most of the Abies concolor from Hyde Park, surely limiting the population of the M. snyderi that can successfully live there. I have yet to ever find a specimen of M. snyderi in New Mexico that wasn\u0026#8217;t in some type of vicinity of Abies concolor. I believe this is its preferred mycorrhizal partner. Another consistency is that they seem to behave slightly differently depending on what other trees are around. When I find these in an area with Abies Concolor and Pinus Ponderosa, the fruit bodies tend to cluster 2-4 together. When I find these with Abies Concolor and gambel oak, they seem to come up singly and more spread out, rarely in clusters. They also like to fruit right by rocks, or the stems of small shrubby plants, or other objects in the environment, maybe because the rocks are absorbing more heat and warming the soil there, or creating some type of other micro climate, retaining moisture, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course they break all these rules from time to time, but this is what I\u0026#8217;ve noticed about M. snyderi.
