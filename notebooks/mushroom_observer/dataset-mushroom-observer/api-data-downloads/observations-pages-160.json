He describes almost no morphological difference between both. Dimensions, shapes, colors, type of ground and spores of both species are almost the same, smell and habitat being exceptions. C. meinhardii should be mycorrhizal partner with conifers (mostly Picea abies), should climb up to upper montane elevations and should have distinct smell on blackpepper. On the other hand, C. splendens should grow at lower elevations, mostly in planes, should be associated with broadleaved trees (mostly Fagus sylvatica) and should have no distinctive smell. The mushrooms photographed grow in mixed mountain wood, Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica being dominant; they were found in montane elevations and have mild, pleasant smell, definitely not on black pepper. So, there was little ground to decide for one or another options. Fortunately (at least for me), it was not necessary.

Microscopy is almost a must. The fungi photographed in this observation have simple septa without clamps. I spent quite some time trying to find clamps in the subhymenium of the branches as well as in the trunk. Only two or three features resembling clamps have been found while vast majority of septa of thin as well as of thick hypha have simple septa. This rules out Ramaria flavescens although other morphological traits, habitat and most of the studied microscopic properties fit well to the find. Similar situation can be assumed for Ramaria Formosa, Ramaria lutea and Ramaria aurea, which all have clamps. Ramaria subbotrytis doesn\u0026#8217;t have clamps but can be ruled out based on spore and basidia dimensions, which clearly don\u0026#8217;t fit to measured values. The best candidate seems to be Ramaria neoformosa. All studied macro- and micro traits fit quite well to the find. Only slightly too long spores are to some extent disturbing. Since I haven’t found any other better option I am staying with this one. Admittedly I don\u0026#8217;t have descriptions of all of them. They are many. Krieglsteiner (2000) estimates 80 of them in Europe and about 200 worldwide while Arora (1986) assumes about 100 species for America.So, a mistake cannot be ruled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing in line of about six sporocarps within a  range of approximately five by one meters; fruit body dimensions up to 12 cm tall and 12 cm wide, the largest weighting 300 g; stump massive, up to 4.5 cm tall and 5 cm wide, branches toward their ends full and round in cross-section, 1-2(3) mm in diameter; fruit body ochre-orange-pink, oac763 (in sRGB color space R245/G173/B127); stump trama white, marmorated, toward edges of cross-section gradually changing to pinkish-orange; does not discolor with time or when bruised; fibrous when dry, not chalky; 5% KOH reaction on stump trama almost none (slightly darker), on branches not strong but distinctive, reddish-pinkish (pale color of oranges); taste mild, indistinctive, after a while slightly bitter; smell mild, pleasant; SP abundant, yellow-ochre-orange, oac812.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Spore dimensions in Breitenbach (1986), p362 reported from Schild (1978) and those reported by MycoBank from the same source differ.
