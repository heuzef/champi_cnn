\u0026#8220;eggs\u0026#8221; found at the base of a shrub outside DRNA office in Bosque de Maricao. I dissected a couple in the field, and to my surprise the context was uniform (greenish) and I saw no apparent developing stinkhorn outline like I would expect with Phallaceae. I took a couple home hoping they would \u0026#8220;hatch\u0026#8221; so I could photograph them. A couple days later I noticed fruit flies (Drosophila sp) attracted to the eggs which appeared to have exudate on the peridium surface despite not having hatched. I removed one and cut it open and the context was now uniform green liquid gleba with a smell of sweet decaying fruit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8212;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMirrored on
