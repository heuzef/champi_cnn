Driving west of Buffalo, Wyoming on Highway 16, you turn north onto U.S. Forest Service Route 31 and drive about 3 miles.  About 100 feet to the north of the road I found these fungi.  Because these species I found were not very prominent (i.e. the tops of them were only about 1/4 \u0026#8211; 1/2 inch above the earth), they could easily have been missed.  The cloudy day made for less lighting and compounded with the forest canopy, they looked like perhaps areas where dead fungi had deteriorated at first glance.  Upon closer inspection, I carefully scooped the dirt away at the base of these specimens (very loose rich forest soil \u0026amp; pine droppings), I found the fungi grew a considerable depth into the earth and clung firmly to the earth.  The base of these specimens was about 7 to 10 inches in circumference, and grew in a circular shape.  I pulled one out of the ground to get photos of the entire fungi and was surprised to find the scent of this fungi was extremely pleasing to me.  It almost smelled like sweetened steamed cauliflower \u0026#8211; a wonderful creamy scent, the color was creamy white at the base and near the tips at the top it was slightly pale yellow.  I found a dying specimen (perhaps had matured and withered in the heat), which had longer tendrils and was darker yellow.  This is probably the most aromatic raw wild mushroom I have ever smelled.  The scent almost made my mouth, water \u0026#8212; it was that pleasant!!  I believe the pines were junipers and other tall thin conifers.  These were growing near fallen trees, some decaying but not close to them but rather, about 8 to 10 feet away.  The branch / coral \u0026#8211; like structure of this fungi easily fell apart in my hands, so they are what I would consider a somewhat fragile species.  I did not notice any color change when I bruised this fungi.  Attached are several photos I took of these.  I see these were found in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, so apparently this is a Wyoming species natural to the region.  I have been in the Bighorn Forest for almost 5 years exploring and this is the first time I came across this type of fungi.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4163,"consensus_id":85,"consensus_name":"Ramaria","location_id":5800,"location_name":"Bighorn National Forest, Wyoming, USA","primary_image_id":244016},{"id":103436,"type":"observation","date":"2012-07-29","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.53328,"created_at":"2012-07-31T05:02:36.000Z","updated_at":"2012-07-31T05:02:40.000Z","number_of_views":17,"last_viewed":"2023-09-20T10:17:35.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eTwo different specimens.
