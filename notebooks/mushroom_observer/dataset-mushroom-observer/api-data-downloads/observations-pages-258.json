Such is also Scleroderma aerolatum. Observation of its spores makes determination rather easy. It is the only species in this genus, which has spores with very coarse and dense spines without reticulation on their surface. Whether this species is mycorrhizal or may be also saprophytic is yet unclear. Most authors consider it mycorrhizal with oak, some also with other trees and some claim also its saprophytic life since it can be found also in grassland. If this find is mycorrhizal, then it is with Fagus sylvatica or Picea abies, but not with Quercus. There are no Quercus trees in this region. Its mycelia threads looked rather saprophytic in this find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDescription: Growing gregariously, more than 10 fruitbodies found; size of sporocarps from 2.3 cm to 3.8 cm and up to 2.5 cm high; stipe rudimentary or absent, peridium thin, flexible and strong; when cut it becomes reddish; smell unpleasant, on chemistry, metal or welding?; taste not determined; 5% KOH reaction on peridium distinctly dark red; spores on mass gray-brown, eventually with some green tint, oac736, but darker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Sony ILCE6000 / Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar E 16-70mm/ f4\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":1323,"consensus_name":"Scleroderma areolatum","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":788048},{"id":291186,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-16","latitude":"19.3111","longitude":"5.625","altitude":394,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69591,"created_at":"2017-09-17T10:30:52.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T16:16:56.000Z","number_of_views":25,"last_viewed":"2024-02-05T12:19:34.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eI tried to id tree\u0026#8230; No luck.
