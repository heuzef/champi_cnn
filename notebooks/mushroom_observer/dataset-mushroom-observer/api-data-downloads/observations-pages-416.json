Most of them are not far from this find. The thallus of this find was sterile. So, characteristic, almost black apothecia shaped as upright painted nails could not be used in the determination. This make my determination somewhat uncertain. However, small (up to 3 cm long and 0.8 – 1.5 cm wide), mostly concave, +/- shiny, only moderately bullate lobes, some minutely pruinose near the margins (hard to see when the thallus is moist); lobes have distinct bluish-black tint except in a completely dry state (eventually, when soaked with rain, slightly bluish-green-black); whitish under side with broad, dark brown to black and flat veins and few, dark, stubby and short rhizines speak in favor of Peltigera neckeri. The thallus was about 20 cm in diameter and firmly adpressed to the substrate and interwoven with the moss. It was difficult to separate the thallus from the substrate. The thallus had mostly non-overlapping lobes and on some places appeared like reduced to scattered lobes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamera.
