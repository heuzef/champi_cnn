They are found at the exact same location and basically the exact same time (August 29 instead of August 25).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey come a neighbor’s lawn in between several mature oaks, a hemlock, and a maple. It is a myco-rich area where I have found at least 5-10 different bolete species and at least 20 others. “Classic oak-subvelutipes” were found at the same time, including a single specimen from about 5-10 feet away. The others differ from that one in many material ways. [I will add that photo at the end \u0026#8211; look for the caption]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe last had rain about a week ago but the ground is far from dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMycelium was white. Cap ranged from dark red to brown. I know from last year that they end up a very dark brown. A few of the younger caps had notable velvet on top, but not all. More mature specimens were flat on top with rounded pores, while younger specimens were flat underneath with a rounded cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pores on younger specimens are a dark orange-red but not the same crimson I see in the \u0026#8220;oak subvelutipes\u0026#8221; nor the brownish orange in our vermiculo-somethings. Both these and the oak-types regularly have a yellow edge on the pores, while the vermiculo-somethings do not. These get much more orange with age, at least partly because the pores are opening and thereby spreading the red shade out. The pores go truly brown as the specimens get older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecimens covered all ages, though I left the rotting ones behind. Context was a little marshmallow-y compared to the oak-types I find. Interesting Note: The temperature thing continues to bear out. The oak-types were colder to the touch even an hour or two later when I examined them all at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a strong but not overpowering mushroom smell. I know that the older ones develop a powerful, almost overwhelming odor so bad that the owner hates to mow them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn last year\u0026#8217;s observation I emphasized the odd staining pattern. Quoting:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The most striking feature is the staining of the context. The underlying, pre-stained context is creamy yellow (the photos seem whiter than they look in life). When cut the stipe very rapidly stained a bright red, while the cap slowly and indifferently stained toward blue\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater finds confirmed that the cherry red began in the base and worked its way up as the mushroom ages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were a bit younger but the pattern continues. The flesh stains bluish green rather than the dark blue I associate with the oak-types, and much slower. Older specimens also display an ever-growing cherry red in the stipe context, beginning at the base and working upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStipe colors varied from mostly yellow, to a brownish tan, to more red, to one oddball that was entirely reddish-brown. By contrast, the oak-type specimen displays a bright-yellow stipe with occasional red, and is much more sensitive to bruising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChemical tests were all indifferent and hard to read. I did them with the drop-and-dab method that clears away extra liquid with a clean q-tip. All tests go ammonia, KOH, and then FeSO4 from left to right. Separate photos were taken on a specimen with the red base in order to see how the different parts of the flesh would react. NOTE: There are two photos of that final photo.

Unfortunately, the nrDNA tandem repeats in MO289538 apparently failed to homogenize in the ITS region.  In other words, the \u0026#8220;barcode gene\u0026#8221; in this organism is represented by more than one ITS sequence.  These ITS sequence variants are essentially identical, but vary in length because of insertion of 1 or more nucleotides at 3 different positions (=points of heterogeneity) in the locus. This resulted in raw sequence chromatograms that had to be worked on hard to get the most of out them because they show sequence mixtures.  Fig. 1 illustrates what the forward read chromatogram looks like upon insertion of an extra base at position #120 in ITS1 in a population of nrDNA tandem repeats.  The assigned base positions are correct and represent the major/shorter variant with 5 T\u0026#8217;s in a row.  The other variant has 6 T\u0026#8217;s, so its peaks beyond that point are shifted over by one position, and the overlapping peaks thus follow a strict and recognizable pattern.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e Based on my thorough analysis of the raw chromatrograms, the uploaded full-length ITS sequence represents one of four sequence variants found in this organism.  The haplotypes in the forward and reverse reads were resolved in converging direction beyond the first and last points of heterogeneity, respectively, and joined at the second (middle) point around character #438.  In each resolution case, I proceeded with the major ITS variant (having taller peaks = larger area under peak).  The reported sequence is the shortest one, 494 base pairs (bps).\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e A BLASTn-100 of this sequence gave RET\u0026#8217;s accession of \u003ccite\u003eAmanita williamsiae\u003c/cite\u003e (MG982484) as the top hit at 99.03% similarity.  The two sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 2.  There are five mismatching positions; one of them is an ambiguity in both sequences.  The other four are not directly associated with any of the noted points of heterogeneity.  The base identities at those positions in my sequence are correct, so the observed differences are real.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1539,"consensus_id":58380,"consensus_name":"Amanita williamsiae","location_id":21091,"location_name":"Franklin Parker Preserve, Woodland Twp., New Jersey, USA","primary_image_id":782699},{"id":289539,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.33933,"created_at":"2017-09-07T00:56:22.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T01:34:21.000Z","number_of_views":47,"last_viewed":"2024-01-17T03:41:41.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eReally gelatinous cap with greenish hues, pores white bruising slighty brown\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":9548,"consensus_id":19325,"consensus_name":"Leccinum longicurvipes","location_id":14758,"location_name":"Franklin Co., Virginia, USA","primary_image_id":782707},{"id":289540,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-04","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.72395,"created_at":"2017-09-07T01:09:47.000Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T05:26:52.000Z","number_of_views":47,"last_viewed":"2022-12-26T10:12:07.000Z","owner_id":2712,"consensus_id":3555,"consensus_name":"Resupinatus applicatus","location_id":4624,"location_name":"McGilvra Woods State Natural Area, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":782709},{"id":289541,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-04","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.82892,"created_at":"2017-09-07T01:11:28.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T01:18:52.000Z","number_of_views":21,"last_viewed":"2023-11-08T18:52:49.000Z","owner_id":5346,"consensus_id":360,"consensus_name":"Armillaria mellea","location_id":11707,"location_name":"Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","primary_image_id":782714},{"id":289542,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-03","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.7434,"created_at":"2017-09-07T01:13:37.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T01:55:53.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2023-08-28T22:48:44.000Z","owner_id":5346,"consensus_id":59505,"consensus_name":"Butyriboletus frostii","location_id":11707,"location_name":"Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","primary_image_id":782715},{"id":289543,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-04","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.74339,"created_at":"2017-09-07T01:16:52.000Z","updated_at":"2018-12-08T00:14:02.000Z","number_of_views":26,"last_viewed":"2023-09-22T07:09:22.000Z","owner_id":5346,"consensus_id":31567,"consensus_name":"Harrya chromapes","location_id":11707,"location_name":"Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","primary_image_id":782717},{"id":289544,"type":"observation","date":"2017-08-22","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69596,"created_at":"2017-09-07T01:26:08.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T04:16:22.000Z","number_of_views":87,"last_viewed":"2023-11-16T10:05:46.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing on a hardwood (Acer?) log with Physisporinus sanguinolentus and an unidentified polypore.
