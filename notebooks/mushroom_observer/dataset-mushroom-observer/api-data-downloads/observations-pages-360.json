The name Flammulina is based on the yellow-orange caps, which shine like little flames in the murky winter colored habitats. It is a rather newly separated species (1999). Several differences in the morphology between Flammulina velutipes and Flammulina elastica (however, very variable) are described in literature, but many, if not most of, authors consider both species indistinguishable solely on morphology. Only DNA analyses, sexual incompatibility and spore shape (particularly Q) and dimensions (mostly their length) separate them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently Flammulina elastica appears a rare species in Slovenia and elsewhere. It is not included neither in the Boletus Informaticus data base (Ref.: 6) nor in the Operational List of Fungi of Slovenia (Ref. 7). Because Flammulina elastica cannot be separated from Flammulina velutipes in field without microscopy, hundreds of historical field observations of the latter can actually be the former. Therefore, published distribution maps of both species seem questionable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than 15 pilei were observed on the trunk from 30 cm above to about 2 m above the ground, most of them were old and hence of very dark color.

It is poisonous since it contains muscarin. Quite interesting is its smell. My impression was: distinct, hard to say on what, but not unpleasant. This contradicts to most descriptions found in literature available to me. While its taste is described quite consistently as unpleasant and bitter (such was also my observation), the descriptions of its smell vary wildly.
