Size, stalk length compared to total length, diameter in relation to the length of sporocarps, slightly bended sporocarps seems to fit within the limits of variability of these species. However, all three species are lignicolous, while this find was fruiting on moss. Only the synoptic key in Ref.5 states that S. flavogenita can occasionally thrive on green plants also (mosses included?). Browsing through my literature moss as a substrate is explicitly mentioned only for Stemonitis herbatica and Stemonitis pallida. Unfortunately, habit of both is not similar to my pictures. Both species are much thicker and shorter and also stalks of both are short compared to total length of sporocarps.

Consequently the descriptions in literature of the habit and host(s) of the species under the name Diatrypella favacea vary widely.  There are mainly two approaches; \u0026#8216;lumpers\u0026#8217; consider Diatrypella favacea in broader sense and consider different spore sizes of finds on different hosts as insignificant, while \u0026#8216;splitters\u0026#8217; find these differences significant (among other traits) and recognize several host specific species. According to them this find would clearly be Diatrypella verruciformis (Ehrh.) Nke., which grows on Corylus sp. only. They consider Diatrypella favacea a species bound exclusively on Betula sp..

suborbicular, flat cushions, which are quite small, less than 10 mm in diameter. But, it can be also abundant, in larger, irregular, widespread fragments, sometimes confluent and covering the whole small branches circumferentially. When looked through a hand lens it appears like an incredible natural filigree of saturated bright yellow lobules set in a delicate, stochastic ornament. Their ends are sorediate at the margin. The lobules are attached to the bark with scattered, white, simple rhizines. This is one of lichens, which can be relatively easily recognized by habit only, without microscope and chemical tests. Eventually it can be confused with very small lobed Xanthoria species, where a test with K solves the dilemma.

But in Slovenia it is rather a rare find because of the lack of such ground. With its bright yellow thallus, black apothecia and black prothallus and characteristically areolate pattern of the thallus, which coarsely resembles a map, it is superficially easy to determine. However the Rhizocarpon geographicum group is extremely polymorphic, still poorly understood species complex. Several taxa have been separated with slightly different chemistry, spore properties and/or habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thallus of Rhizocarpon geographicum grows very slowly, only about 0.1 mm per year (Ref.4).
