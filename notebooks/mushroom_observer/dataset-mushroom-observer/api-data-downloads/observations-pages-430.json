Either that, or it’s actually one of those species, and they actually can have forked gills\u0026#8230;but I think this is unlikely since spore measurements are the same for L. hygrophoroides and L. rugatus but different for L. lentus in “North American Species of Lactarius”.\u003cbr /\u003e\n  Before digging deeper into Russula and Lactarius this year, I never checked my L.
