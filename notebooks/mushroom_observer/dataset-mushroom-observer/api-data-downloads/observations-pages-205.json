For decades it hasn\u0026#8217;t been recorded in Europe. However, Christan (2008) (Ref.2.) described it as present also in Europe in 2008. Also Hagar (2015) (Ref.:3.) is mentioning finds in Europe. Recently done mycological survey of the region of Triglav National Park, Slovenia revealed several finds in east Julian Alps (Ref.:4.). It has been found in four UTM sub-squares of this region so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe traits of this find fit well to literature. This species is macroscopically easy to confuse with small fruit bodies of Ramaria largentii. But Ramaria largentii has clamped basidia and hypha and somewhat smaller spores. I was unable to find clamps. Spore and basidia dimensions fit very well to literature, as well as relatively long sterigmata (average 8 microns). Also a few exceptionally long and deformed spores, which are characteristically produced by Ramaria longispora (Ref.:2) have been observed. One is shown on Picture 1M (arrow).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing solitary; fruit body dimensions: 6 cm tall and 3.5 cm wide; stipe solid, not branched up to 2.5 cm height and about 2 cm in diameter; SP faint, pale ocher-yellow, oac806 (?), color uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":3531,"consensus_name":"Ramaria longispora","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":608180},{"id":235546,"type":"observation","date":"2016-03-26","latitude":"37.7848","longitude":"-122.1306","altitude":245,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.73883,"created_at":"2016-03-29T10:37:06.000Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T10:37:09.000Z","number_of_views":24,"last_viewed":"2023-11-27T15:43:27.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eUnder coast live oak.
