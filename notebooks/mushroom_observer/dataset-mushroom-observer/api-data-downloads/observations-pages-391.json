The stipe was inserted into the ground by at least 6 cm, and its total recovery was not possible due to the fragile nature of the waterlogged tissue in the area of the volval sack (the soil was very wet). I looked hard for the broken off stipe base and volva but couldn’t find them.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis collection was found 15-20 yards away from \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/427938\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 427938\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, so first I thought they were the same.  However, a more careful comparison suggested they were not (see photos of the two caps side by side).  This was further supported by the difference in the color of dried gills, which was pale pinkish-orange in this collection, and, eventually, by the derived nrITS sequences.\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Cap footprint = 7 \u0026#215; 6.3 cm; flesh = 6 mm thick above stipe; striations = 1-1.3 cm long (0.29-0.37R / 0.33-0.43R)\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Gills = 5-6 mm wide\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Stipe = at least 16 cm long overall, with the subterranean portion of 6 cm long (I nicked the stipe surface at the ground level with my knife); 1.1 cm wide at the flaring apex, 9 mm at its narrowest point just below the apex, gradually widening to 1.4 cm in the middle and 1.6 cm near the broken off base\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eDNA Sequencing Results and Discussion\u003c/b\u003e (posted 23-May-21; updated on 24-Jan-23):\u003cbr /\u003e\nDr. Kudzma sampled this collection for ITS.  The forward read delivers a full-length ITS1-5.8S region and the first 34 characters of ITS2 for a total length of 384 base pairs (bps).  The read then becomes hopelessly heterogeneous.  The reverse read gives the last 88 characters of ITS2 before becoming hopelessly non-specific, too.  Thus, there are two points of heterogeneity in ITS2, and that\u0026#8217;s why the two reads cannot be joined together for a contiguous full-length ITS sequence.  The length of the unresolved region in MO427979 turns out to be 44 bps long, as full-length accessions of this species can be found in GenBank.\u003cbr /\u003e\nBoth ITS fragments are a 100% match to 6 accessions of \u003ccite\u003eAmanita homolalittenii\u003c/cite\u003e and 1 accession of \u003ccite\u003eAmanita\u003c/cite\u003e \u0026#8216;\u003ccite\u003esp-MO04\u003c/cite\u003e\u0026#8217;.

The difference between the ITS sequences of these two taxa lies in the lengths of a poly-AC repeat in ITS1 and a poly-G repeat in ITS2. \u003cbr /\u003e\n RET still thinks the two species are not conspecific because they look different.

I found it shortly after my arrival to the site as a very young fruitbody with a conical cap and decided to pick at the very end of my foray.  When I came back to harvest it almost 3  hours later, it managed to grow taller and expand its cap.  The cap is white with just a smattering of cream color on the disc.

First of all,  full-length sequence is not possible because of a complex heterogeneity pattern at the 3\u0026#8217; end of ITS2 sublocus.  For this reason, the forward and reverse read cannot be joined together.  Also, the long forward read is interspersed with regions \u0026#8220;on-and-off\u0026#8221; heterogeneity, some of which I was able to resolve, and peppered with isolated single-base ambiguities.\u003cbr /\u003e\nDuring this work, I became aware that I had recently seen this sequence.

Alignment of the two sequences is shown in \u003cb\u003eFig. 1\u003c/b\u003e.  Incidentally, MO421190 was found ~150 yards away from the present observation.
