at base of stem just soil attatched and the stem didnt change width as it went into the mushroom. I then broke the mushroom in half after know spores dropped and to my surprise the stem ran all the way to the top of the odd mushroom with a lavender core in the stem and the mushroom itself. It still apears to be inside out. The gill like structure on the exterior have a lavender color then possible browning with age or moisture after it showed itself. After examining the inside of the mushroom there is no reproductive tissue of any type on the inside??? Found in a leafy patch that was moist with tipuwana tipus being the leaf matter. The only mushroom i have found in this exact location is parasols.
