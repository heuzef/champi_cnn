Traditionally, M. overholtsii is thought to produce large fruit bodies on coniferous wood during cold/cool weather, often while snow is melting, restricted to high-elevation location in western North America. Recent sequencing efforts suggest this species is also found east of the Rockies, during cold/cool weather, not necessarily at high elevation. Relevant observations (eg. \u003ca href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/37566563\"\u003ehttps://www.inaturalist.org/observations/37566563\u003c/a\u003e) suggest the eastern NA version produces smaller fruit bodies.

found these in a planter that had been out for the winter. The mini rose plant did not survive the winter. I remember seeing one mushroom last year in this planter, but the mini rose was still alive, so I just plucked it without even looking at what it was. The substrate is potting soil and whatever the mini rose was packed in. There are a lot of wood chips in the soil, as you can see in the photos. I initially used AI to identify it as wavy caps. I took this finding to Facebook, Reddit and iNaturalist, which was a fun ride. Friendly people instructed me on taking better pictures to assist with ID, and the consensus from the local experts was that they were Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata. I hope to have an excellent spore print photo up soon. I have been obsessed with this for the last three days, but I will end this story here. Thanks!
