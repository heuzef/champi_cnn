Facebook Group, All Things Polypore\u003cbr /\u003e\n(I\u0026#8217;m reposting here for a more permanent collection)\u003cbr /\u003e\nME:  This lovely polypore is on a fallen oak in Athens, Georgia USA. There were three clusters growing near each other (see photo): younger-more white; intermediate; older-more brown. All three groups have a browish rim and up close are velvety on top. Pores 3 per mm. Cap 1 cm thick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePATRICK  LEACOCK SAID:  I remembered that Trametes cubensis is one of the ones with pores that are regular and not elongated. That is my best guess for this, and it is a southern species. I was surprised to learn at the NAMA foray (NC 2015) that it can be whitish as well as grayish (NAMA AR 2013). Some photos online show the brown zones too. \u003ca href=\"http://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name/5676\"\u003ehttp://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name/5676\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEARLIER POST: I would venture to say it is one of the species in that whole Trametes gibbosa / elegans group. This being the one that does not have elongate pores (can\u0026#8217;t remember now which one that is). They can sometimes show a brownish edge.
