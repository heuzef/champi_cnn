They may be of very different shape: pointed, with very small cups of approximately the same diameter as podetia, but also with wide cups, which are in most cases deformed and have proliferations with irregular, convex apothecia on top. Pale brown color (becomes semi-translucent when wet) of apothecia is characteristic.
