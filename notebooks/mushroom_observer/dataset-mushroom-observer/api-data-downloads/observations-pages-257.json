Three names were relevant in Europe: Buchwaldoboletus hemichrysus (Berk. \u0026amp; M.A. Curtis) Pilát, Buchwaldoboletus sphaerocephalus (Barla) Watling \u0026amp; T.H. Li and Buchwaldoboletus lignicola (Kallenb.) Pilát. Taxonomical history of the genus is complex and at the time (in 1947) these three names (or at least two) were synonymous and put to genus Pulveroboletus. Even today several scholars consider B. hemichrysus and B. sphaerocephalus as synonyms. However, currently Index Fungorum recognizes all three mention names as current species names. B. hemichrysus is considered as an American species (reports from Europe refer to B. sphaerocephalus according to Ref.:11) while B. sphaerocephalus (people who consider B. sphaerocephalus = B. hemichrysus would use the latter name) and B. lignicola are European species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDescription of characteristic traits of Buchwaldoboletus lignicola in literature is widely scattered. For example, in the literature given below the color of the hut is described as: beige, brown, brown-ochre, brown-reddish, golden-brown, light brown, ochraceous, ochre-creamy, ochre-yellow, orange yellow, orange-brown, reddish-brown, rusty, rusty-brown, some shade of brown, yellow-brown and yellow-ochre, while for the alternative B. sphaerocephalus/hemychrisus similar colors are given from yellow to brown with the average shifted toward yellow. Obviously, if one finds a single fruitbody, such information is of little help for determination. In addition, this find seems yellow through, which fits best to the description \u0026#8220;completely yellow fruitbody\u0026#8221; given in Ref.: 2. Based on this B. sphaerocephalus would seem a better choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Krieglsteiner (2000), Ref.5., p 287 in his key as well as Ortiz-Santana (2011), Ref.12., p 2 both state as an important discriminating trait of B. lignicola a thin gelatinous layer between tomentum and trama of the hut, which is not present in B. sphaerocephalus. This layer was clearly visible in this find. The layer was apparent even during preparation of the cutis for microscopy at low magnification of a dissecting microscope. Also hypha of this layer with no clamps corresponds well to the description in Breitenbach (1991), Ref.2. This led me to believe that the find is B. lignicola.  Many other traits fit well to this choice. Yet, several do not. Color of the hut seems too yellow (young fruitbody?), the shape of the stipe is not equal as described for B. lignicola but club shaped, rooted and too thick, observed bluing fits only marginally to the description. Redding of the base of the stipe when cut is mentioned nowhere. Spore dimensions seem OK taking into account wide scatter of data from different sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDescription of the find.\u003cbr /\u003e\nGrowing solitary; hut 85 mm in diameter, trama 20 mm thick, pore layer up to 8 mm thick; tubes detersible (can be easily separated from trama); pores only slightly decurrent; stipe club shaped and slightly rooting, 8 cm long and up to 4 cm in diameter; fruitbody not bluing when handled, only pores do slightly (blue-green); when cut trama slowly bluing here and there to some extent, mostly in the base of the stipe and above pore layer, rooting part of the stipe changes to reddish; bluing disappears after about half on an hour and trama becomes again pale yellowish; after a day or two pore layer becomes dark brown with olive tint and the whole fruitbody turns darker, muddy yellow-orange-reddish;  SP abundant, brown, oac818.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Slovenia protected according to: Uredba o zavarovanih prostoživečih vrstah gliv, Uradni list RS, št. 58/2011 (Regulation of protected wild fungi, Official Gazette of Republic Slovenia, no. 58/2011), (2011).

It\u0026#8217;s interesting that though large pieces of loose yellow UV material were found clinging to the stipe and bulb, the UV remnants on the cap were white.

This is a common challenge with ellipsoid spores that I discussed in \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/174500\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 174500\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.  Furthermore, for some reason these spores really liked to clump together in large clusters, leaving relatively few isolated spores with an unobstructed view and making this scope session a rather lengthy exercise.  Yet, I was able to find enough smaller spores in proper orientation by searching for them specifically, and perhaps measured more of them consciously.  As a result, the average spore length is slightly depressed and should perhaps be closer to 9 μm.  Needless to say, my measurements were anything but random, but advantage of this targeted approach is that it allows to accurately assess the max/min length and width.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1539,"consensus_id":62319,"consensus_name":"Amanita umbilicata","location_id":21091,"location_name":"Franklin Parker Preserve, Woodland Twp., New Jersey, USA","primary_image_id":785625},{"id":290362,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-13","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.56302,"created_at":"2017-09-14T02:08:23.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T02:09:46.000Z","number_of_views":20,"last_viewed":"2022-12-26T16:05:07.000Z","owner_id":5346,"consensus_id":16001,"consensus_name":"Boletus subcaerulescens","location_id":11707,"location_name":"Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","primary_image_id":785635},{"id":290363,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-08","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.53964,"created_at":"2017-09-14T02:11:11.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T21:43:27.000Z","number_of_views":77,"last_viewed":"2024-03-28T01:52:39.000Z","owner_id":1685,"consensus_id":51247,"consensus_name":"Amyloporia xantha","location_id":4177,"location_name":"Dallas, Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":785637},{"id":290364,"type":"observation","date":"2017-09-13","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.56302,"created_at":"2017-09-14T02:12:23.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T02:22:55.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2023-01-08T11:33:49.000Z","owner_id":5346,"consensus_id":16001,"consensus_name":"Boletus subcaerulescens","location_id":11707,"location_name":"Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","primary_image_id":785639},{"id":290365,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-12","latitude":"35.2712","longitude":"-83.5738","altitude":1265,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.61852,"created_at":"2017-09-14T02:14:40.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T02:14:43.000Z","number_of_views":17,"last_viewed":"2024-01-06T04:42:12.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound along the Appalachian Trail near Tellico Gap. \u003cbr /\u003e\nCap scaly.
