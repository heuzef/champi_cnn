The white color of the webby stuff (as seen in the first photo) is probably due to the spore drop from the laccaria, as evidenced by the clusters of spores seen in the micro photos.

I suspect this spiny thing is just something that drifted in and ended up on the slide.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":29417,"consensus_name":"Arachnida","location_id":5793,"location_name":"Sweet Valley, Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":276380},{"id":114775,"type":"observation","date":"2012-10-16","latitude":"37.8885","longitude":"-122.2733","altitude":80,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.65066,"created_at":"2012-10-29T06:11:06.000Z","updated_at":"2012-10-29T06:11:11.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2023-09-05T01:50:20.000Z","owner_id":2304,"consensus_id":61,"consensus_name":"Scleroderma laeve","location_id":742,"location_name":"Berkeley, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":276385},{"id":114776,"type":"observation","date":"2012-10-28","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.8127,"created_at":"2012-10-29T06:11:18.000Z","updated_at":"2012-10-29T06:42:02.000Z","number_of_views":31,"last_viewed":"2023-08-09T12:20:26.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eAn old weathered specimen.
