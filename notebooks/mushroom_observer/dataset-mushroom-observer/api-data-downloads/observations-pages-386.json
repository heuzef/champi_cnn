Context white slowly turning blue, bluer toward pores, then tan. Pores rapidly turning blue-black.  Taste mild, slight acidic taste near pore layer, texture rubbery.  Aroma pleasant mushroomy, attractive. Stipe yellow to tan, no reticulation, shadow of pink/red color.  Following morning:  There is not a shred of red in the cap at any age.  As you can see in the slice, the oxidation was quickly blue fading to brown and fading to original yellow by morning.  I’m guessing that the slugs and squirrels both like these mushrooms because of the abrasions and the stems scattered about with no caps.  They are under what I call sourwood or Tupelo, photo of leaves included.

In summary, two main full-length ITS haplotypes were pieced together from the forward and reverse reads and posted to this observation.  They share 10 mismatching positions, meaning that they are 98.4% similar.  The sequences are technically joined contigs stitched together at the 2 \u003csup\u003end\u003c/sup\u003e point of heterogeneity, but the two reads actually share a 269 bp overlap because the heterogeneity in the reverse read was resolved well into ITS1 to get assignments for the first 3 isolated ambiguities.  Also see \u003cb\u003eFig. 1\u003c/b\u003e showing an alignment of the two haplotypes and marking the differences between them.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe major haplotype is present in a slightly larger quantity (~1.2:1 ratio from area under the curve) and is overall one base longer than the other.  However, while a 1 base difference usually suggests a single point of heterogeneity, there are actually 3 points of heterogeneity seen in both reads (1 in the ITS1 sublocus and 2 in the ITS2 sublocus), two of which cancel each other out in terms of length gained/lost by either of the two haplotypes.  In all 3 cases, the heterogeneity pattern is of the basic 1-base frame shift type, which can be easily followed and used for peak reassignments for a specific haplotype.  One of the collateral benefits of sorting out the heterogeneity in the reverse read is that it allowed for the resolution of 7 individual ambiguities and their assignment to each haplotype (see \u003cb\u003eFig. 1\u003c/b\u003e).\u003cbr /\u003e\nSo, was all this hard work justified?  Yes, without a doubt.  First, a search of the GenBank database revealed that there are no accessions labeled as \u0026#8220;Russula ochroleucoides\u0026#8221; (as of 20-Jun-22).  Second, the haplotype sequences are only 96.4-97.0% similar to two accessions derived from the same Russula sp. voucher from Panama, KM594792 and KY548870.  The genetic distance between two organisms suggests they are closely related, but not conspecific.
