Size of the shiny black, stalked apothecia, obovoid to weakly bell-shaped apothecia, very thin, almost invisible grayish thallus, absence of pruina, the ratio of sporocarp height to stalk diameter (AVG=11.6, SD=2.4, N=15) and substratum speak in favor of Calicium glaucellum. Quite some time I was unable to decide between Calicium abietinum and Calicium glaucellum. Sporocarps seem to have too thin stalks compared to their height for Calicium abietinum. Also no pruina was seen. Finally, I found out that Index Fungorum considers both names as synonyms in spite of the fact that most of my literature considers both names as separate species. Obviously they must be quite variable.
