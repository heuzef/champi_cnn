After the first PCR reaction failed with ITS1F/ITS4 primers, two new DNA extracts were made and PCR was performed with the primer pairs ITSU1/ITSU4, LR0R/LR5, ITS1F/ITS4B and ITS1F/ITS4b-truncated, ITS1/ITS2 and ITS3/ITS4.   After a total of 13 PCR reactions were attempted and none were successful, it was determined that the DNA was too degraded to analyze, likely due to bacterial decomposition.

It is a rare opportunity to see what the plateau was like before the cedar cutters and dairy farmers cleared the forests. It is located by heading west out of town on the Comboyne Road, turning right into Colling Road and and following the signs to Boorganna Nature Reserve and Rawson Falls. There is a 2.7 km walking track that leads through remnant rainforest to a lookout at the 40 m high Rawson Falls. There is a brochure available at the Comboyne Community Centre. The reserve possesses sub-tropical and eucalypt forest, diverse birdlife and fauna and there are excellent picnic areas. In spring it is noted for its flowering orange blossom and spotted cinnamon orchids.
