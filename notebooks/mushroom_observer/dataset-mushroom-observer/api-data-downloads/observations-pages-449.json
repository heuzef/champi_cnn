The older specimens are insect infected quickly, but the young ones are typically good. The insects infect from the base upward, the stipe changes from yellow to red exterior and you can almost cut it along that color line to determine how high the insects have gotten. They are quick growing and nearly daily in one patch of forest maybe 10\u0026#215;20m you go pick the choice young specimens and fill a couple ice cream pails full.
