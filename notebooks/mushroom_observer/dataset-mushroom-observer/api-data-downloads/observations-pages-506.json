specimen looks similar to Trametes versicolor with a few exceptions. Look at the growth pattern among the cap margin. This was a fresh specimen, and it appears to have grown in this frilly pattern, similar in appearance to some species of caterpillars. You can see visible pores and thickness in the area. Also, teeth appear on the fertile surface, along with pores. I found this specimen on a hardwood tree twig.

i have been researching on psilocybe mairei which led me to  the original locality of this mushroom where it was first described by Maire in his paper cited as \u0026#8220;Hypholoma Cyanescens\u0026#8221;.\u003cbr /\u003e\nOn december 7th i found (1) suspicious looking mushroom growing on a small piece of rotten wood under cedrus (cedrus atlantica) which featured a seperable pellicule, I took it with me (didn\u0026#8217;t think much of it) till the cap started to change color from orangish brown to a more pallid color, and some \u0026#8220;bluing\u0026#8221; started to appear, i took some photos and let it spore print without cutting the cap, no spores were visible even after 24 hours!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week later and after 3 days of rain, i went back to the same exact location and found this lot, the caps featured like previously a very slimy-to-touch pellicule which mostly had that greenish-bluish color, When i was examining them at home the caps started to change color very rapidly! I quickly cut them and placed them on foil and isolated them with cups moisted with alchohol for printing. But again all 8 mushrooms didnt leave any spore print that could determine the color.. The stem\u0026#8217;s bluing became very visible after the spore printing process (26 hours after picking) Any questions for more clarification pls ask them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal notes i have taken (as a begginer):\u003cbr /\u003e\n• Relatively strong smell (very mushroom-y)\u003cbr /\u003e\n•Grew on soil (filled with woody debris) + some grew on small pieces of rotten wood.\u003cbr /\u003e\n• No ring zone present to my rookie eyes.\u003cbr /\u003e\n• Stem hollow in the center as seen in the picture.\u003cbr /\u003e\n• Habitat is a cedrus atlantica forrest at an elevation of approx 1300 meters.\u003cbr /\u003e\n• Spotted like 20+ of this mushroom growing in a 5 meter radius.\u003cbr /\u003e\n• The bluing is still visible even after drying.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":115303,"consensus_id":28452,"consensus_name":"Psilocybe mairei","location_id":15769,"location_name":"Algeria","primary_image_id":1656989},{"id":546393,"type":"observation","date":"2024-02-14","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.862512,"created_at":"2024-02-14T13:23:52.000Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T13:25:36.000Z","number_of_views":5,"last_viewed":"2024-03-19T18:01:14.000Z","owner_id":6442,"consensus_id":186,"consensus_name":"Lepiota atrodisca","location_id":11194,"location_name":"Moreleta Kloof Nature Reserve, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa","primary_image_id":1656991},{"id":546394,"type":"observation","date":"2024-02-14","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.862514,"created_at":"2024-02-14T13:31:38.000Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T13:31:44.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2024-04-16T11:41:40.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eSlime mould\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6442,"consensus_id":884,"consensus_name":"Stemonitis","location_id":11194,"location_name":"Moreleta Kloof Nature Reserve, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa","primary_image_id":1656995},{"id":546395,"type":"observation","date":"2024-02-14","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.0,"created_at":"2024-02-14T13:35:46.000Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T13:35:52.000Z","number_of_views":6,"last_viewed":"2024-03-19T18:01:10.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eSingle, cap diameter 40mm.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6442,"consensus_id":1,"consensus_name":"Fungi","location_id":11194,"location_name":"Moreleta Kloof Nature Reserve, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa","primary_image_id":1657000},{"id":546396,"type":"observation","date":"2024-02-13","latitude":"34.2916","longitude":"-117.8404","altitude":1004,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.841886,"created_at":"2024-02-14T17:13:04.000Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T19:20:22.000Z","number_of_views":11,"last_viewed":"2024-02-29T01:36:33.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn ground, under live oak trees.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":165701,"consensus_id":20738,"consensus_name":"Cortinarius subg.
