The cap color though is gorgeous.\u003cbr /\u003e\nTypically, the fruiting bodies are small, with caps usually not exceeding 2\u0026quot;, but the cap of 210360 (which I called \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Betula+subraternus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eB. subraternus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) was 3.7\u0026quot; across.

The angular pores and tubes are concolorous, yellow to greenish-yellow, readily bruising greenish-blue to blue; pores getting larger toward the stipe, pore surface irregular.  The stipe is yellow at the apex and reddish-orange below, either smooth entirely or noticeably ridged in the apex, some dots and punctae visible in the upper stipe; basal mycelium whitish to pale yellow, creeping as a dusting along the stipe.  The exposed flesh in the cap and upper stipe is light to medium yellow, sometimes bright yellow, bluing slowly just above the tubes and at the cap-stipe juncture.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1539,"consensus_id":50413,"consensus_name":"Hortiboletus","location_id":7327,"location_name":"Maple Shade Twp., Burlington Co., New Jersey, USA","primary_image_id":927516},{"id":333816,"type":"observation","date":"2018-09-15","latitude":"30.5182","longitude":"-95.6784","altitude":74,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69855,"created_at":"2018-09-20T00:36:23.000Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T00:36:27.000Z","number_of_views":11,"last_viewed":"2022-09-05T23:29:19.000Z","owner_id":11303,"consensus_id":3352,"consensus_name":"Pholiota polychroa","location_id":17492,"location_name":"Caney Creek at Lone Star Hiking Trail, Montgomery Co., Texas, USA","primary_image_id":927526},{"id":333817,"type":"observation","date":"2018-09-15","latitude":"30.5182","longitude":"-95.6784","altitude":74,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.849277,"created_at":"2018-09-20T00:36:57.000Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T00:37:00.000Z","number_of_views":12,"last_viewed":"2021-09-30T22:31:33.000Z","owner_id":11303,"consensus_id":281,"consensus_name":"Crepidotus mollis","location_id":17492,"location_name":"Caney Creek at Lone Star Hiking Trail, Montgomery Co., Texas, USA","primary_image_id":927527},{"id":333818,"type":"observation","date":"2018-09-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.73113,"created_at":"2018-09-20T00:38:02.000Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T00:38:09.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2022-12-26T20:26:03.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMixed woods with oak and hemlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStipe over 2 cm thick on large one.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":28732,"consensus_name":"Cortinarius subg.
