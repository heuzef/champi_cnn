april 15th 2017. Around a poplar mature tree near a river. There were also a couple of spruces around. There were still snow everywhere except near the base of the trees. The ground was very wet. At the very first sight i tought this was an old/dried gyromitra ancilis but it wasn\u0026#8217;t old. The mushroom was very fresh. The diameter is between 4-5 cm and the stem was well developed. The deeply pleated hymenophore was a dark marron with some reddish reflections, and the texture was velvet-like. The external surface extending to the foot was very dark grey, almost black, with a texture mostly like felt. The flesh was white. No particular smell was noted. i havn\u0026#8217;t tasted the specimen. It was solitary. Under the microscope we unfortunately couldn\u0026#8217;t locate any spores. It was probably no yet mature. So we have no ID to propose to this unusual specimen.

Both H. cupuliformis and H. fibrosa have smooth, rounded stems that dry yellow, however, H. fibrosa separates/splits into folds and irregular caps at maturity(which all of my collection did, similar to Otidea in appearance). ID from another member on iNaturalist(Fred Rhoades) claims H. cupuliformis has shorter stems than H. fibrosa, but all of the multiple sources I have reviewed show the converse(H. fibrosa having the shorter stem between the two).
