A similar mushroom grew in this same area about a year ago and lived for a couple months before I finally tore it up out of curiosity. That one was similarly misshapen and was very solid and firm, much as this one currently feels. I would describe the firmness like a well cooked steak. This one is very close to the ground so I am not able to see the underside. It does not appear to have those \u0026#8220;gills\u0026#8221; like I see in grocery store type mushrooms. It\u0026#8217;s hard to tell if it\u0026#8217;s growing from a single stem or not. When pushing a ruler around the underside of it, the ruler can only go under it about 1 inch before hitting something solid. This one started growing about 2 weeks ago. The dark brown spots on it started as what looked very much like a bootprint, possibly from our gardeners. The neighbors next door used to have a tree on the other side of this wall about 5 years ago\u0026#8230;I\u0026#8217;m not sure what species. The grassy area where this is growing is often shaded from the wall and there is a sprinkler near by, so it is often damp.
