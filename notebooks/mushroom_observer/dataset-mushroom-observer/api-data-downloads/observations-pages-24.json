It was the only one I could find of its sort. It was growing in a hard wood and conifer laced forest with heavy leaf litter. North facing with very little direct sunlight. This forest is alway rather dark even on the brightest of days. The day before I found this mushroom it had rained. The temps were in the mid 80\u0026#8217;s. This was my first venture into the woods to locate mushrooms. Some of the images are somewhat out of focus but I believe you will be able to assertain its features from the thumbnail which seems to elarge rather well.

The entire mushroom is a shockingly bright shade of orange.  The caps are perfectly hemispherical, radially lined, and so glossy and uniform they look as if they\u0026#8217;re made of plastic.  The stalks are unblemished and almost entirely equal. The upper stalks fade only slightly as they approach the cap.  The bases of the separate stalks are all clustered together at one location on the wood.  They seem to be fastened to the substrate, and one another, with numerous whitish fibers that cover the base and ascend the stalk briefly.  The gills were essentially the same spectacular orange as the cap and stipe, although this species has white spores, which could cause them to appear faded.  I found these two clusters growing on a fallen maple tree.  The immature group was growing underneath the bark, so I stripped it away to show all of the stalks meeting, and forming one connection for the entire cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[admin \u0026#8211; Sat Aug 14 02:03:56 +0000 2010]: Changed location name from \u0026#8216;Norwich, Windsor Co., Vermont, USA\u0026#8217; to \u0026#8216;Norwich, Vermont, USA\u0026#8217;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1376,"consensus_id":151,"consensus_name":"Mycena leaiana","location_id":1793,"location_name":"Norwich, Vermont, USA","primary_image_id":58075},{"id":25743,"type":"observation","date":"2009-08-21","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.73801,"created_at":"2009-09-25T18:11:02.000Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T01:04:30.000Z","number_of_views":207,"last_viewed":"2023-11-13T00:42:47.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn display at the 12th annual La Feria del Hongo in Senguio, Michoacan.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":123,"consensus_id":6256,"consensus_name":"Climacocystis borealis","location_id":380,"location_name":"Senguio, Michoacan, Mexico","primary_image_id":58079},{"id":25744,"type":"observation","date":"2009-08-21","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.73801,"created_at":"2009-09-25T18:14:11.000Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T01:18:45.000Z","number_of_views":36,"last_viewed":"2024-01-07T20:52:37.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn display at the 12th annual La Feria del Hongo in Senguio, Michoacan.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":123,"consensus_id":147,"consensus_name":"Mycena","location_id":380,"location_name":"Senguio, Michoacan, Mexico","primary_image_id":58083},{"id":25746,"type":"observation","date":"2009-08-21","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.854109,"created_at":"2009-09-25T18:17:11.000Z","updated_at":"2009-09-25T18:17:11.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2023-08-24T21:17:55.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn display at the 12th annual La Feria del Hongo in Senguio, Michoacan.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":123,"consensus_id":6523,"consensus_name":"Cystodermella granulosa","location_id":380,"location_name":"Senguio, Michoacan, Mexico","primary_image_id":58086},{"id":25747,"type":"observation","date":"2009-08-21","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.854112,"created_at":"2009-09-25T18:20:39.000Z","updated_at":"2009-09-25T18:20:39.000Z","number_of_views":14,"last_viewed":"2024-01-20T03:46:05.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn display at the 12th annual La Feria del Hongo in Senguio, Michoacan.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":123,"consensus_id":64,"consensus_name":"Sarcosphaera coronaria","location_id":380,"location_name":"Senguio, Michoacan, Mexico","primary_image_id":58088},{"id":25748,"type":"observation","date":"2009-09-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.841457,"created_at":"2009-09-25T18:37:33.000Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T12:24:32.000Z","number_of_views":140,"last_viewed":"2023-11-26T11:16:40.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eLactarius lignyotus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommon name: Chocolate Milky\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[admin \u0026#8211; Sat Aug 14 02:03:56 +0000 2010]: Changed location name from \u0026#8216;Norwich, Windsor Co., Vermont, USA\u0026#8217; to \u0026#8216;Norwich, Vermont, USA\u0026#8217;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1376,"consensus_id":202,"consensus_name":"Lactarius lignyotellus","location_id":1793,"location_name":"Norwich, Vermont, USA","primary_image_id":58090},{"id":25749,"type":"observation","date":"2009-09-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70411,"created_at":"2009-09-25T18:55:33.000Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T17:00:35.000Z","number_of_views":341,"last_viewed":"2023-11-16T12:55:11.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eThese are a first for me and the only place I could find any information on them was in the Bessette and Roody books.

After rehydrating the tan caps were up to 15mm in diameter and had one or more concentric darker brown rings.  The top was flat but had an indented center.  The surface was “textured”.  (I don’t know the right term for it.) The underside had tan gills that attached to the stalk and ran down it slightly.  The relatively stout stalk was up to 20mm long and attached to the underside near one edge.  There was no ring, but a mass of some sort of tissue was seen at the junction of the stalk with the cap.

Apparently not dropping spores. Tried on both yellow and white paper. GILLS: white, mal-formed, scrunched and convoluted, crowded, wavy, growing together then apart, with plentiful cross-hatching especially close to the cap. CAP: strongly inrolled, strong striations and crenulate ridges on the outer 1.3 inches of the cap. Taste of cap/gills not hot, but bad, with chemical aftertaste for several minutes after chewing and spitting out. Cap is nearly exactly 4 inches across, depressed in center; with brown center with a distinct color change 1-1.5 inches from center, becoming white with crenulate ridges, striations, and dotted with orange, brown, or orange-brown. Height: 4 inches. Clear, glue-like exudate on outer 1/2 inch of cap. STIPE: 2.5-3 inches before attaching to cap, equal, solid at top and bottom, but partially hollow between, between hollows filled with some cottony material. No change in base of stipe (or stipe) after handling. HABITAT: In mycorrhizal association with Quercus palustris, which is not native to this area. ODOR: faint, not pleasant, somewhat chemical as fresh. After 2 days drying, odor of fresh-cut raw potato. In Arora\u0026#8217;s Mushrooms Demystified, under Macowanites magna, there is an extension to Elasmomyces odoratus from Washington that is similar. Specimen is very young, which could explains why the odor is still faint at this time. Will dry and submit for herbarium collection, as this looks more Russula-like than Macowanites-like; yet has some Macowanites characteristics.
