11 samples of this Agaricus in a grassy area near a pond.  The soil was pH 7.8 and hard-packed.  Six of the specimens were mature and five were immature.  The immatures were in various states of development from buttons to beginning to open.  The gills were free.  The gills of the immatures were very light pink in the youngest to decidedly pink in the older examples.  The gills were very close together (dense) and rarely gill ridges would be bifurcated about 80 percent of the distance from the stipes to the margins  The caps of immatures were domed whereas the cap of the mature examples were flat with a bit of peaking on the central part of the cap (umbontae, I think).   The diameters of the immature stipes were notably greater than the diameters of the mature stipes.  Several specimens had obvious rings on the stipes.\u003cbr /\u003e\nImmature cap colors were off white with tan scales near the tops.
