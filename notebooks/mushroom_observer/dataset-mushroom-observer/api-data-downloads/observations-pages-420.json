A few very small spores appeared to lack pigmentation in the KOH mount. These are likely immature, or perhaps anomalies. One spore with length approximately 14 microns was observed. Shapes (apparently dependent upon how a spore was profiled in the mount) are either more-or-less elliptical or tending toward subfusiform. \u003cbr /\u003e\nPileipellis mounted in 4% KOH. Elements were basically hyaline, only slightly pigmented when mounted in KOH. Photos were taken both through an old monocular scope and a newer binocular scope. In general, the newer scope shows color more accurately, but photos snapped through one of the two eyepieces tend to lack resolution. In this case, due to the hyaline nature of the elements observed, details did not show up very well in the any of the photos. To alleviate this, I edited the photos by decreasing brightness, increasing contrast, and darkening via adjustment of \u0026#8220;saturation\u0026#8221;. Elements are septate, occasionally apically tapered and/or napiform, widths mostly 6-12 microns. Globose/subglobose elements were not observed. \u003cbr /\u003e\nOriginally, I had considered this collection as representative of the North American taxon previously thought to be the same as (and that some authors continue to compare to) Boletus/Xerocomus/Xerocomellus/Hortiboletus rubellus, a Eurasian species. According to Kuo, the Eurasina taxon may actually occur in NA under imported/planted trees. This particular collection comes from a native Pennsylvania forest featuring hemlock, beech, birch, oak, tulip poplar, and white ash. It is quite unlikely this observation represents the Eurasian taxon Hortiboletus rubellus (the current genus according to Index Fungorum). As points of reference I compared to the descriptions of \u0026#8220;rubellus\u0026#8221; found at Mushroom Expert (Kuo) and within Bessette/Roody \u0026#8220;North American Boletes\u0026#8221; (BR). After discussing this comparison with Jean Lodge and Igor Safonov, the consensus is that this collection represents some taxon other than what Kuo and BR refer to as \u0026#8220;rubellus\u0026#8221;. One trait that appears to support my initial belief in this comparison is the hyaline nature of the elements within the pileipellis. Traits that support an alternative include: variable shapes of the elements within the pileipellis; spore Q appearing to be slightly larger than what is observed in a photo by Kuo; stipe appears to feature red longitudinal streaks rather than a punctate ornamentation. \u003cbr /\u003e\nAll micro photos taken with mount in KOH.

I distinctly remember avoiding mowing it down. The tree grew quickly, It’s now about 15 feet tall. Yesterday as I mowed the path near this tree I noticed this yellow amanita growing a few inches away from the base. Just as I finished mowing a rain shower moved in. By the time I returned to harvest this mushroom it was wet with soil and cut grass adhered to the cap surface.
