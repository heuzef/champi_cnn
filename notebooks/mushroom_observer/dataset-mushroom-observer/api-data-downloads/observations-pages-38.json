I said to my students, \u0026#8220;oh it looks like it has a parasite.  I\u0026#8217;ll bet that it is a pyrenomycete asco or maybe a mold like \u003ci\u003eCladosporium\u003c/i\u003e.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when we got back to the lab, I scraped a bit of the black, and it came off very easily.  hmmm.  I mounted it in some 3% KOH and found clamps on the hyphae and spiny spores.    Well. I thought, I should have cleaned off the razor blade better.  that\u0026#8217;s not an ascomycete.   So I got a new razor blade and made a second scrape.  Again the same thing.

In every phyical aspect it looks like someone took the caps from Boletus subtomentosus and stuck them on the stipes of Leccinum rugosoceps. These mushrooms were well past prime in 100 degree heat w/ high humidity and before I could get them home for a better look the maggots were already getting the best of these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[admin \u0026#8211; Sat Aug 14 02:03:40 +0000 2010]: Changed location name from \u0026#8216;Nehantic State Forest, Lyme CT\u0026#8217; to \u0026#8216;Nehantic State Forest, Lyme, Connecticut, USA\u0026#8217;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1415,"consensus_id":2824,"consensus_name":"Leccinum rugosiceps","location_id":2719,"location_name":"Nehantic State Forest, Lyme, Connecticut, USA","primary_image_id":96904},{"id":49731,"type":"observation","date":"2010-08-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.42353,"created_at":"2010-08-05T23:29:37.000Z","updated_at":"2010-08-14T18:31:39.000Z","number_of_views":46,"last_viewed":"2024-01-12T05:37:42.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eUnder oak.
