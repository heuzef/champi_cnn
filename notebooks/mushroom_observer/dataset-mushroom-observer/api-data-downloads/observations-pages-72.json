In the evening of the next day I showed the fruitbodies the members of our local mushroom club. When I unpacked them a very pronounced odor of marzipan complied the room. The intensity was so high that the smell would surely have noticed by me at the finding place \u0026#8211; but this was not the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week later, on the 6th July, I visited the locality again. But all of the collected fruitbodies had a radish-like smell. The smell remained unchanged at the following day after storage in the refrigerator. Ludwig (2001) indicates in his compendium of mushrooms \u0026#8220;flour-like\u0026#8221; as a third possible odor note. As early as 1985 Laber refers to the different smells of Ph. christinae.
