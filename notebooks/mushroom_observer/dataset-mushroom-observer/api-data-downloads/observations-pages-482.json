Small and yellow, about the size of a golf ball. The cap is pale in the center and a more vivid mustard yellow on the edges. Maybe a slight greenish tint over all. The stalk is white, though parts have similar tint as the cap. There are like horizontal ridges around the stalk where there is just a tint of color. I don\u0026#8217;t know the name for that. It\u0026#8217;s not exactly the ring from veil. Reticulum? We got almost 4 inches of rain in 1 week. Since then it\u0026#8217;s been warm and dry for 3 days and I found this growing in dry compost. There\u0026#8217;s hay mulch around, but this was definitely growing in the soil. It wasn\u0026#8217;t there yesterday. I didn\u0026#8217;t want to pick it to look at the gills until it\u0026#8217;s grown a bit more and opened up. If it grows more and opens up. I\u0026#8217;ll take another look tomorrow.\u003cbr /\u003e\nEDIT, Day 2:\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe mushroom has gotten larger, two more sprouted beneath it. Color has changed a bit. The cap has lost the yellow/green tint. Now more off-white and tan. I cut the stem open. There were yellow parts inside, and the stem isn\u0026#8217;t hollow. It has a pleasant sweet smell. The gills are gray/lilac/rusty brown. I think the rusty brown part is from the spore. Brought it inside and I put the cap on a piece of paper to get a spore print. Should have one tomorrow. FWIW, the mushroom sprouted about 10 feet from a hazelnut shrub. Close enough for the roots to reach it.
