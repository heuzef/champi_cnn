The caps ranged from the largest being about four inches brownish yellow with what looks like Brown specks (possibly scale) to the smaller ones brownish-red around an inch ti an inch and a half in length. These mushrooms most definitely stained blue when bending the cap skin away from the gills. They also stained distinctively blue along the gills from gentle handling. I know my blue staining from hunting psilocybin cubensis for years. The stem of the larger one was hollow inside. The odor was ever so slightly fruity/flowery with a earthy mushroomy but pleasant smell overpowering that. The caps were watery skin smooth. This may be due to all the rain lately, as well. Most were found growing singularly although there we e a few couples. Upon sampling a tiny portion of the cap skin, it tasted mild with hardly any distinctive taste, nothing to set it apart from any other ordinary mushroom. I\u0026#8217;m wondering if it might be a gymnopilus sapineus species. The stem had some reddish brown streaking.
