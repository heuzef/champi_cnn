The cap surface was dry and possessed scale-like patches. This bolete looked mature hence the cracked/scaley cap. The pores are HUGE! The pore flesh color was yellow-greenish and was moist/squishy. Pore tubes measured ~ 1.5 cm deep. The pore tissue bruised brown when scratched. The stipe was slightly club-shaped and was centrally located. The stipe surface was grooved, rigid, flakey, reticulate, and dry along with a brownish/cinnamon color. When an odor test was performed, it had an Earthy to sweet smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis bolete was found growing on dense, rotty leaf litter under an oak tree (which I believe makes sense, as it is mycorrhizal).
