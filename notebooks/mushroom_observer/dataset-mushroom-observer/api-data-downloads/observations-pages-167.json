Most of what I recovered (they are apparently quite gregarious) was already decomposing.  Picture 3 is an example of one such specimen.  The few that were still in good shape had a dull steel-blue, slightly concaved cap, a similarly colored stipe, and a violet-hued gill surface.  No or little latex in the specimens I recovered, though the gill surface of the older specimens exhibited a host of colors, including blue, green, blue-green, and rusty red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8212;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMirrored on iNaturalist as \u003ca href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/144100026\"\u003eobservation 144100026\u003c/a\u003e on December 10, 2022.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6663,"consensus_id":2764,"consensus_name":"Lactarius paradoxus","location_id":11036,"location_name":"Nederland, Texas, USA","primary_image_id":492995},{"id":193667,"type":"observation","date":"2014-10-03","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.68644,"created_at":"2014-12-15T04:38:42.000Z","updated_at":"2014-12-15T04:43:18.000Z","number_of_views":38,"last_viewed":"2024-01-19T03:23:40.000Z","owner_id":6498,"consensus_id":20650,"consensus_name":"Cortinarius","location_id":6767,"location_name":"Deep River County Park, Hobart, Indiana, USA","primary_image_id":493000},{"id":193668,"type":"observation","date":"2014-12-07","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.68725,"created_at":"2014-12-15T04:46:53.000Z","updated_at":"2014-12-15T04:47:08.000Z","number_of_views":46,"last_viewed":"2023-11-14T16:21:09.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMixed conifer/hardwood forest.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4122,"consensus_id":474,"consensus_name":"Amanita smithiana","location_id":11034,"location_name":"Butte Creek Access Rd., Humboldt Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":493004},{"id":193669,"type":"observation","date":"2014-11-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.64992,"created_at":"2014-12-15T04:48:40.000Z","updated_at":"2014-12-15T16:04:59.000Z","number_of_views":25,"last_viewed":"2024-02-06T06:58:07.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound in small grassy field between parking lot and the Albion river.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6858,"consensus_id":28841,"consensus_name":"Coprinopsis subsect.

Growing sporadically under along ground, up the sides and to the top. Look to be a young fruiting. I will go back tomorrow to see if there are more or more mature specimens. 3-7cm in width. Keyed out fairly easily for my first legit keying adventure to pleurotus ostreatus. But these are light tan to darker browns with some light blue/green/violet tones on the cap. Gills are tan.
