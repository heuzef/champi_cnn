The caps and stipes were orange/tan, the gills were darker orange, and the spores that were on the partial veil were dark orange, while the inside was a yellowish/white flesh. When bruised, the exterior surface turned dark orange. The cap of the largest specimen was an 1 in wide and 0.3 in tall. The stipe was 1.75 inch tall and bulged 1/3 of the way up the base. The stipe was 0.5 in wide at the top and 0.75 in wide at the site of the bulge. The partial veil was thick and intact and seemed to collect some of the spores, and also was still fully covering the gills on some of the smaller mushrooms. The stipe was very smooth and the striations were vertical. The cap was smooth with what seemed like slight patches of darker orange color but were not raised. The gills were attached and had a darker orange color especially at the ends of them. The gills did not run up or down the stipe, they went horizontally to it.
