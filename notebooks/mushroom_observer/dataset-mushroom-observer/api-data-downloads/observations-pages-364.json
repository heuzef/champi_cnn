find any macro-morphological differences between them. The dark ochre spores alone help distinguish them from similar Russula. R. basifurcata has a whitish to creamy buff cap that becomes yellow and often develops pink tones around the margin. It also has cream to pale yellow gills that are fused and/or forked near the stipe, pale yellow spores, and a mild to slightly bitter taste. R. chamaeleotina has a pink to rose-colored when young (often with a whitish disc), becoming salmon pink with a yellowish orange disc in age. It has creamy yellow to ochre gills and a mild taste. R. maculata is very similar to the previous species, but has a red cap with a paler disc. It is very common during wet winters in southern California.\u003cbr /\u003e\n(2016 Schwarz and Siegel Pg. 228)\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":8624,"consensus_id":109353,"consensus_name":"Russula \"ochre-oaks\"","location_id":21,"location_name":"Novato, Marin Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1147859},{"id":400679,"type":"observation","date":"2020-01-26","latitude":"38.6734","longitude":"-121.6698","altitude":9,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.853262,"created_at":"2020-01-26T11:13:51.000Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T07:23:58.000Z","number_of_views":24,"last_viewed":"2021-10-09T04:16:04.000Z","owner_id":38884,"consensus_id":147,"consensus_name":"Mycena","location_id":2544,"location_name":"Clearlake Oaks, Lake Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1147864},{"id":400680,"type":"observation","date":"2020-01-26","latitude":"39.0242","longitude":"-122.5515","altitude":517,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.853262,"created_at":"2020-01-26T11:15:20.000Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T07:21:06.000Z","number_of_views":35,"last_viewed":"2023-10-13T20:00:12.000Z","owner_id":38884,"consensus_id":60552,"consensus_name":"Mycena","location_id":2544,"location_name":"Clearlake Oaks, Lake Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1147866},{"id":400681,"type":"observation","date":"2020-01-26","latitude":"39.0242","longitude":"-122.5515","altitude":517,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.54352,"created_at":"2020-01-26T11:16:38.000Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T15:48:00.000Z","number_of_views":29,"last_viewed":"2021-05-08T01:08:24.000Z","owner_id":38884,"consensus_id":31094,"consensus_name":"Duplicate","location_id":2544,"location_name":"Clearlake Oaks, Lake Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1147870},{"id":400682,"type":"observation","date":"2020-01-26","latitude":"39.0242","longitude":"-122.5515","altitude":517,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70652,"created_at":"2020-01-26T11:17:21.000Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T07:20:50.000Z","number_of_views":35,"last_viewed":"2021-10-09T04:16:07.000Z","owner_id":38884,"consensus_id":107661,"consensus_name":"Clitocybe nuda group","location_id":2544,"location_name":"Clearlake Oaks, Lake Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1147872},{"id":400683,"type":"observation","date":"2020-01-25","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.743252,"created_at":"2020-01-26T14:34:41.000Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T15:00:08.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2024-02-03T13:34:34.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing directly out of the side of a Cork Oak tree.\u003cbr /\u003e\nNo spore print available.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":38710,"consensus_id":359,"consensus_name":"Armillaria","location_id":1591,"location_name":"Bidwell Park, Chico, Butte Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1147877},{"id":400684,"type":"observation","date":"2020-01-25","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.860624,"created_at":"2020-01-26T15:08:20.000Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T05:44:12.000Z","number_of_views":21,"last_viewed":"2024-01-07T13:15:53.000Z","owner_id":9652,"consensus_id":677,"consensus_name":"Hygrophorus","location_id":12843,"location_name":"New Bullards Bar Reservoir, Yuba Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1148142},{"id":400685,"type":"observation","date":"2020-01-25","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.7213,"created_at":"2020-01-26T15:17:31.000Z","updated_at":"2020-02-15T19:42:18.000Z","number_of_views":30,"last_viewed":"2024-02-03T13:40:46.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eearth clubs were terrestrial and white, then largely pale buff in age;
