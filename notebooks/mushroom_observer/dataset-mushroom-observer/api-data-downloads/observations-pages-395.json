Unfortunately by the time I came across these specimens we were already losing light (it happens so early these days) so many of the pictures are taken under a 5500k light source. The cap was very soft, spongey and was tacky to the touch, the cap was slightly acidic with the acidity seeming to come from the cap skin, the scent was indistinct. The pores bruised brown and are responsible for the dark line across the top of the stipe shown in a few pictures. The flesh was white upon bisection taking on a pale yellow grey tone slowly, and with a few pinky spots in the base of the stipe (noted in both specimens I found).

The targeted amplicon was ITS1F ==\u0026gt; LR22, meaning that a full-length ITS and the first 300+ bps of LSU should have been procured as a contiguous sequence under ideal conditions, with at least some overlap between the reads.  However, due to unknown technical issues affecting a good number of samples processed late last year, many generated reads came out short/truncated.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn this case, the forward read delivered just the first 230 bps of ITS (5\u0026#8217; end) before the peaks disappeared into the noisy baseline, and the reverse read barely crossed into the 3\u0026#8217; end of ITS2 before the same thing happened.  Thus the two reads cannot be connected.  The two fragments are posted to this obsie.\u003cbr /\u003e\nStill, despite this shortcoming, the short reads are long enough for publication in GenBank.
