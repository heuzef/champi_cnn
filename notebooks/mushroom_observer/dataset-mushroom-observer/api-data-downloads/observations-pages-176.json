cluster came up today in the \u0026#8220;mushroom pile\u0026#8221; area of our yard.  We have a corner of the yard where our young persimmon sapling is growing that has become the mushroom spot for all old or inedible fruiting bodies for the last few seasons(corner fence w/very little sun exposure).  This week the species happened to be small mica caps against the fence.  I have found Geastrum spp., Rhizopogon app., Marasmius oreades, Lycoperdon, Scleroderma and multiple species of Agaricus in our yard so far in the last two seasons.  Not positive, but pretty convinced our throwing of these wild species in the urban setting have brought them up over time at this current location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three distinctly different mica caps that fruit in Yakima, WA throughout the year from my personal observation;  A very small version that looks identical to the West side of WA fruiters(thin long stem, shiny., a floccose version that is much stouter and shorter(caps are almost not visible due to paper thin floccose skin surrounding fruitbodies, and finally, this species that exhibits the mica dust on cap AND the flocking on margins and young fruit bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m looking forward to seeing what other species of fungi will show up and out compete local fungal residents in the yard \u0026#8211; hopefully, most of them will come up throughout the remainder of this Spring/Summer season in our ever evolving \u0026#8220;mushroom spot.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElevation: 1500ft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemp: 78, sunny.  Low 80\u0026#8217;s over the last three days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUPDATED 5/8/15:  Images of fully mature specimens four days after beginning of visible flush.  The caps still exhibit the tenuous flocculant(with striation) behavior as with C.flocculosus, but also have mica looking dust on young specimens.  I am leaning more toward C.flocculosus after updated growth5/8. Very large at maturity- fully expanded caps approx. 4cm wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpdated 5/29/15:  Notes below each additional image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUPDATED 6/12/15: New satellite of primordial young buttons coming up in caespitose lumps near the ever growing persimmon.
