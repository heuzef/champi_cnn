Young pilei are almost black tinged deep blue or violet; the gills are initially whitish or lightly bluish. These colors are then gradually changing to more pinkish and finally to brownish colors. One can find quite differently looking pilei next to each other. The gills have characteristic and usually distinctive blue-black edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mushrooms were photographed on two places near each other on the same pasture.

It had apparently dawned on no one but our trusty hillbilly guide, Bill Wild \u0026#8212; who subsisted on a diet of Marlboro Reds, Doritos, uncooked Top Ramen and Natural Ice while charging up and down hillsides \u0026#8212; that the section of the burn across the river in between the two well-separated bridges would be prime, untouched morelling territory.  One scouting mission in a punctured raft, doctored with mailing tape and only good for one crossing before requiring reinflation, proved him right.  We camped for eight days, collecting from morning to late afternoon, eating Annie\u0026#8217;s soups and sardines in the middle of grizzly country like college kid bear bait, field drying what we could on lengths of window screen stretched taught between downed logs.  It would take several more crossings (and much more mailing tape), under cover of near darkness, to \u0026#8220;illegally\u0026#8221; shuttle those 400lbs back across the river and to the safety of waiting dehydrators in Missoula.
