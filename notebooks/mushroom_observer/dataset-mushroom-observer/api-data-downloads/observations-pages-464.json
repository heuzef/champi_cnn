In wash after heavy rains from tropical storm Fiona under sea grape (Coccoloba uvifera) and Coccoloba microstachya. Found within meters of the beach in coastal xerophytic forest, basidiomata were exposed after rains washed away the leaf litter/topsoil (hypogeous). Truffles were mostly half-buried, many appear to have animal herbivory, from small bites to examples that were almost fully consumed, leaving just a small bit of exposed gleba and the attached base. Hermit crabs were conspicuously present in the area with the foraged truffles, as well as other crab species such as blue land crab and red backed land crabs. I collected 6 hermit crabs in the immediate area of the consumed truffles which I housed overnight to collect their droppings, and was able to confirm the presence of fungal spores which correspond to those of the collection. Fresh basidiomes are pale, becoming more brown upon handling/drying. Odor and taste distinctly reminiscent of raw artichoke. Gleba is dry and compact chalk-like in the most mature specimens but never becoming a loose powder. Spores in the 10-15 um range, thick walled, appearing smooth but some with a subtle pustulate or minutely undulating outline that is barely perceptible in LM but might imply texture if viewed under SEM. Inamyloid, appearing very minutely asperulate in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s, but again barely if at all perceptible.
