Sometimes found as small caespitose clusters with up to four to eight individuals fused together at the base, and found in dense clusters taking up nearly of a square foot of space. The right environmental conditions for prolific growth seem to be cold winter weather and rain along the coastal regions in oak woodland, pine and fir forests, or in redwood forests. Also collected in the spring after the snow melt in higher elevations up to 2,438 meters (8,000 feet) in high desert pinyon and juniper woodland, in high desert transition forests of Southern California, and in densely forested areas where moisture seems to persist. Collected growing on very decayed wood, on duff, in grass, and on soil.

Lycoperdon perlatum has worldwide distribution and ecological variance, being found growing on a variety of substrates from leaf litter to decaying wood, and is often divided into separate varieties due to its morphological variation. This puffball is distinct from others due to the exaggerated pseudostipe and spinose exoperidium. Persoon (1796) did not designate a type specimen, and a neotype has not been designated. The herbarium material that Demoulin (Bates 2004) used to circumscribe Lycoperdon perlatum, from the National Herbarium Nederland, Leiden, did not have collection dates or locations with the specimens, making them unavailable as potential lectotype. These collections now have barcode numbers in addition to their accession numbers; (accession number L 910.258-671, L 910.258-676, L 910.258-681, L 910.258-761), (barcode number L 0116482, L 0116484, L 0116483, L 0116486, L0116487). The ITS sequence data nests Lycoperdon perlatum with the diaphragm-forming puffballs, as was shown by Bates (2004). As well, Calvatia sculpta is shown to be sister to the clade of Lycoperdon perlatum with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP. Being the type species for the genus Lycoperdon, Lycoperdon perlatum does not seem phylogenetically related to many of the species within Lycoperdon. In light of this evidence, this shows that ITS data is not enough to resolve taxonomic questions with the Lycoperdaceae, suggesting that multi loci gene analysis is necessary to further clarify their taxonomic positions.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":175,"consensus_name":"Lycoperdon perlatum","location_id":6342,"location_name":"Vision Rd., Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1087126},{"id":381749,"type":"observation","date":"2009-11-15","latitude":"37.8734","longitude":"-122.2401","altitude":197,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.43766,"created_at":"2019-09-10T04:33:07.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T21:02:45.000Z","number_of_views":148,"last_viewed":"2024-01-12T23:24:47.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFor a full taxonomic description:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13687\"\u003ehttps://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13687\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHabitat: Lycoperdon pyriforme is one of the few Lycoperdaceae that is known to grow strictly lignicolous, and is a common white rot fungus in Central Western California. Most often it is collected from woody debris, very decayed wood, or buried wood of hardwood and conifer tree species. It can occasionally be found growing in soil, or seemingly without the presence of and wood debris. Typically this puffball grows in regions where no other lignicolous Lycoperdales occur (Krüger 2001). Most often Lycoperdon pyriforme is found in large gregarious clusters, with up to several hundred fruitbodies attached to one another with thick elastic rhizomorphs. It has also been noted to grow as a solitary fruitbody on occasion. The growing habit depends on environmental conditions that favor prolific growth for large clusters to form, rain and moisture being the key factor. Lycoperdon pyriforme is found in the subarctic, boreal, and temperate zones of Eurasia and North America. Surprisingly, it has been reported from high elevations of the Swiss Alps and the Himalayas of Nepal, and also occurring in subtropical zones as well. Among the Geographic Subdivisions of California, this species can be found in Northwestern California, in the Cascade Range, in Central Western California, and parts of the Sierra Nevada. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDistribution: Known from many parts of the United States, and previously reported from Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

There are a few other puffballs that have been found growing on wood in California: Calvatia sculpta, Lycoperdon perlatum, and Lycoperdon nigrescens. However, a lignicolous growing habit is not common for puffball species (Alfredo 2014). The use of a good compound light microscope and locating the finger-like cystidia-type cells projecting from the exoperidium tissue on Lycoperdon pyriforme is a key to proper identification. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\tIn 2001, Krüger revealed a distinction between lignicolous Lycoperdaceae species based on the DNA analysis results, and discussed how Lycoperdon pyriforme does not cluster with other Lycoperdon species. The results showed that 9 sequences of Lycoperdon pyriforme fell outside the Lycoperdon clade, but within the Lepiota outgroup. In 2003 Krüger transferred Lycoperdon pyriforme into Morganella based primarily on its lignicolous growing habit. Bates\u0026#8217; (2004) ITS sequencing results also showed one sequence of Morganella pyriforme as outside of the Lycoperdon clade, sister to one sequence of Disciseda candida and distinct from two other Morganella species. ITS sequence analysis of collections from California show three sequences of Lycoperdon pyriforme forming its own clade with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP support, sister to a supported Disciseda clade containing several sequences of D. candida, D. cervina and D. johnstonii. Larsson and Jeppson (2008) showed that Morganella pyriforme was sister to the Lycoperdon clade with 70% bootstrap and 93% PP support. Based on these results, they recognized Morganella pyriformis as a species of Lycoperdon. None of these studies included the type species of Morganella, M. mexicana Zeller, so the taxonomic status of Morganella remains questionable. However, Lycoperdon pyriforme being sister to Disciseda, and basal to Bovista and Lycoperdon clades, warrants additional genes to be sequenced to further clarify the taxonomic position of it amongst the other Lycoperdaceae.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":174,"consensus_name":"Lycoperdon pyriforme","location_id":742,"location_name":"Berkeley, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1087127},{"id":381750,"type":"observation","date":"2019-08-22","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.72121,"created_at":"2019-09-10T04:38:35.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-07T00:54:57.000Z","number_of_views":22,"last_viewed":"2023-09-19T12:37:56.000Z","owner_id":2712,"consensus_id":61206,"consensus_name":"Inonotus obliquus","location_id":7952,"location_name":"Ed's Lake National Recreation Trail, Nicolet-Chequamegon National Forest, Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":1087129},{"id":381751,"type":"observation","date":"2019-08-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.856863,"created_at":"2019-09-10T05:15:02.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T05:17:21.000Z","number_of_views":21,"last_viewed":"2022-09-16T13:30:46.000Z","owner_id":2304,"consensus_id":28162,"consensus_name":"Pseudoboletus parasiticus","location_id":21080,"location_name":"South of Middle Rd., Martha’s Vineyard Island, Massachusetts, USA","primary_image_id":1087141},{"id":381752,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-09","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.52151,"created_at":"2019-09-10T11:48:41.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T11:48:47.000Z","number_of_views":11,"last_viewed":"2023-11-25T07:12:14.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHabitat:\u003c/b\u003e mixed hemlock and hardwoods  \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eSubstrate:\u003c/b\u003e leaf litter  \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eAbundance:\u003c/b\u003e Few\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":8658,"consensus_id":6315,"consensus_name":"Lactarius chrysorrheus","location_id":16422,"location_name":"Durham, New Hampshire, USA","primary_image_id":1087142},{"id":381753,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-09","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.52157,"created_at":"2019-09-10T11:56:55.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T11:57:01.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2023-10-13T10:07:57.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHabitat:\u003c/b\u003e mixed hemlock and hardwoods \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eSubstrate:\u003c/b\u003e Rotting log \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eAbundance:\u003c/b\u003e Few\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":8658,"consensus_id":3356,"consensus_name":"Pholiota squarrosa","location_id":16422,"location_name":"Durham, New Hampshire, USA","primary_image_id":1087145},{"id":381754,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-09","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.49417,"created_at":"2019-09-10T11:59:32.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T14:11:03.000Z","number_of_views":20,"last_viewed":"2023-09-24T19:07:57.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHabitat:\u003c/b\u003e mixed hemlock and hardwoods  \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eSubstrate:\u003c/b\u003e moss covered rotten conifer \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eAbundance:\u003c/b\u003e Quite a Few\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":8658,"consensus_id":61758,"consensus_name":"Xeromphalina campanella group","location_id":16422,"location_name":"Durham, New Hampshire, USA","primary_image_id":1087148},{"id":381755,"type":"observation","date":"2019-09-09","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.34198,"created_at":"2019-09-10T12:16:03.000Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T13:52:01.000Z","number_of_views":21,"last_viewed":"2023-09-24T17:28:52.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eCollected this solitary large, mature Laccaria species growing on (and firmly attached to) natural wood mulch at the edge of a mixed woodland.
