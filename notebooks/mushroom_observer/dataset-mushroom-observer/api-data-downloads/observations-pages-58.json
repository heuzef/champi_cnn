That\u0026#8217;s about it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went out to get this mushroom as a favor to my cousin who is studying to be an herbalist in California. She was visiting Wisconsin and I said I\u0026#8217;d look for stuff at my in-law\u0026#8217;s woods during the holiday. I\u0026#8217;d bring back what I could find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing what I know now, that was almost an impossible mission and I have no idea how I could have possibly found this thing and why I turned down the trail I did at the exact time I did. It was in a deciduous forest in northern Wisconsin in an area  where there are mainly yellow and sweet birch (black birch), maple, oak, pine and evergreens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time, I just wanted to confirm it, but I was afraid I wouldn\u0026#8217;t be able to find it again and the mosquitoes were all over me. I saw it on the back side of a sweet birch that had a damaged area, it was right next to a tiny little stream, so it took a little balancing so I didn\u0026#8217;t fall in. I grabbed a rock and hit the Chaga. The rock bounced off. They are solidly on the trees, are hard, but the inner \u0026#8220;cork\u0026#8221; leaves them pliable so they have some give to them. I was able to break it cleanly from the tree and bring it back to my in-law\u0026#8217;s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe family was not impressed and it was aptly named \u0026#8220;the turd\u0026#8221;. I took pictures of the turd, posted to my cousin who wasn\u0026#8217;t sure exactly if I got what she thought it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was certain after seeing it on Roger\u0026#8217;s Mushrooms. Then I realized what I did. It was still alive, with a fruiting body on it. I killed the mushroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Roger\u0026#8217;s and other sites and books\u0026#8230; this grows on 1 in 15,000 birch trees. The fruiting body is rarely found as it normally drops off. A Chaga grows on birch trees that have a damaged area and are going to die anyway. This Chaga was on the tree for quite a while, but would have been on it for a lot longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt really didn\u0026#8217;t have much of a smell to it. My cousin said it smelled like medicine to her. I don\u0026#8217;t have a good sense of smell. The fruiting body was very cool to the touch and was like suede. It was a dark yellow ochre on one small section of it and the rest was a chocolate brown. It was good enough to eat. As the days went on, it look distressed and was turning out what looked like white spores on the surface. It was still cool, but didn\u0026#8217;t look healthy. The remainder was fine and was dry. You may see in some pictures the change to the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back up the hill, took my husband with me and we braved the mosquitoes again. I had him hold the Chaga against the tree, right where it was when I took it off, just to show how it was placed when it was alive. Surprisingly at my reach. So, maybe it was fate I found it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cousin has it and is making a tincture from it. The final weight was over 2 lbs. Probably enough Chaga for the rest of my days. She did manage to get it on a plane back to California, so I was glad my \u0026#8220;turd\u0026#8221; wasn\u0026#8217;t confiscated. I didn\u0026#8217;t want it to go, but I did finally let it be.

In fact, I\u0026#8217;m almost certain I got the end result, but is always some doubt. Let me explain: \u003cbr /\u003e\nApparently there was no distinction between the thallus of the two lichen. In the field I made the spot tests to the thallus and got the following results: C-, K + red, KC + red (fading). At home, with the help of Generic key to “script” lichens (from Sonoran Flora) posted by Jason in a comment to Observation \u003ca href=\"http://mushroomobserver.org/68273\"\u003eMO68273\u003c/a\u003e, I made the choices in the key as follows: \u003cbr /\u003e\n1b. spores septate or muriform (\u0026#8212;\u0026gt;)\u003cbr /\u003e\n2b. spores muriform or septate with blocky cells and spore walls evenly thickened (\u0026#8212;\u0026gt;)\u003cbr /\u003e\n3b. spores 3- or more-septate or muriform (\u0026#8212;\u0026gt;)\u003cbr /\u003e\n5b. ascomata without thalline margin . . . \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Opegraphaceae\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eOpegraphaceae\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e s. lato.\u003cbr /\u003e\nNext I did the microscopy and after some searching I came to the conclusion that the data fit perfectly to the genus \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Opegrapha\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eOpegrapha\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and, in particular, to the species \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Opegrapha+herbarum\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eO. herbarum\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, with the exception of the results of chemical tests, that for this species are (according to \u0026#8220;CNALH\u0026#8221;): C-, K-, KC-. I suspected then that the results obtained initially were for the \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lecanora\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eLecanora\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and I essayed the K reaction in a place of the thallus where there was no apothecia of the  lirellae. The result was conclusive: K + red (pure). This allowed me to identify also the species of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lecanora\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eLecanora\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (see \u003ca

However I am wandering about the picture No.12. One can see a pseudoaethalia in a quite decomposed state where many of individual sporangia have a small pink bump in the center, which looks like a pseudocapillitium, which takes the form of a columnella-like central body. If my assumption is correct then this character may eventually testify for a Tubireffa casparyi, which is much less common than T. ferruginosa. Unfortunately, I was unable to find additional information about this species or some additional information whether such a central body can be seen also on Tubiferra ferruginosa. A second \u0026#8216;problem\u0026#8217; is the log. According to Ref. (2) T. ferruginosa substrate are confers and rarely alder or birch. It is almost certain that the log in my case was none of these.
