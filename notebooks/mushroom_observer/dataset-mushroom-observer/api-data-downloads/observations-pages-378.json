The reads have a bit of common overlap in the middle to give the so called \u0026#8220;joined contig\u0026#8221;.  The sequence becomes legible from just before the ITS6R primer area and goes all the way to the LR7 primer (the 3\u0026#8217; end of the PCR amplicon), which was seen and edited out.  Unlike it\u0026#8217;s often the case with ITS, it\u0026#8217;s not possible to get a \u003cins\u003econsensus\u003c/ins\u003e sequence for LSU with just two reads due to the length of the span from the start of the locus to the LR7 primer area.  All reads eventually start losing resolution after 600 bps, and sometimes sooner, which is the nature of the beast.  However, if the reads are of good quality, joined contigs are a perfectly satisfactory result.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe long LR0R read had to be worked on because the sequence quickly became heteromorphic.  Fortunately, it was possible to confidently resolve the two haplotypes to the point where the LR3R read picked up (as a single set of peaks, naturally).  However, there were 4 positions represented by triple peaks that couldn\u0026#8217;t be resolved, as they likely represented ambiguous sites in both haplotypes.  A reverse read from LR5 might be helpful to confirm or even resolve these ambiguities, but is unnecessary considering that the sequence leads to a good ID.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e A BLASTn search of the first 911 bases, which represents the most commonly sequenced region of nrLSU (from start to the LR5 primer area) gave Rod Tulloss\u0026#8217; 11 accessions of \u003ccite\u003eAmanita whetstoneae\u003c/cite\u003e as top hits at 98.8-99.6% similarity.
