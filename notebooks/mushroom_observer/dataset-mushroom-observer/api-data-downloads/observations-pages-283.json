It prefers branches of Quercus sp. trees; however, the specimen photographed was found on Fraxinus ornus branches and twigs. It is a sensitive species to pollution hence it is much rarer in populated regions of industrialized countries and already regionally extinct in some parts of Europe. Its lobes are thin, very wavy, with abundant soralia and scarce black cilia at the margins. Underside is black with simple rhizines in the center and tan-colored and bare at margins. Apothecia are generally considered very rare; however, this was not the case for this observation. The species has been traditionally used for medical purposes in India as a diuretic and headache relief. It has proven sedative and antibiotic effects (Ref.5). Many specimens have been observed at the place of this observation. Pictures show the lichen in moist state (except picture 1. in dry state).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro

This new local company \u0026#8220;Myco-up-rrhizal\u0026#8221; do a fantastic job and my hope and prayer is that they have continued and future successes, both locally and abroad.  A couple was asking questions regarding medicinal fungi, grow kits and preparations for fungi.  I felt truly blessed and honored to be part of the conversation and ultimately promoted multiple sales for this company in the process of explaining growth habits, preparations, drying processes and medicinally valuable constituents for not only the varnished Ganoderma complex, but also for Trametes versicolor, Hericium and many other species that arose to the conversation while I was perusing their tables selection/offers.  For only 20$ this kit accompanied me home and has been growing on the kitchen table at a steady and resulting handsome, evenly fruiting pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs seen on the bag, I cut an opening to introduce O2 on 5/15/18 and have been exposing the kit for 2 to 3hrs each day on a regular schedule.  The less oxygen this species, and other varnished Ganoderma spp. receive the thinner and longer(antlered shaped) the fruiting bodies grow.  In ancient China and Japan the \u0026#8220;antlered form\u0026#8221; of Reishi/Ling Chi were most sought after and revered, most noteably by the \u0026#8220;Iron Emperor\u0026#8221; Chin Chi HuangDI who as most folks know was obsessed with Taoist practices and consuming the 5 elements to achieve immortality.  Unfortunately for Huangdi the \u0026#8220;metal\u0026#8221; elemental representative he would consume was liquid Mercury and was the ultimate cause for his demise\u0026#8230;\u003cbr /\u003e\nNot only are the antlered form beautiful, but have higher concentrations of Terpenes, triterpenes, sterols, etc.  The patent I published in 2015 for a different species-Laricifomes officinalis(Agarikon) was prompted by this research and personal use and prescription with Agarikon that I had harvested and subsequently cloned harvested ABOVE 3000ft. elevation/locations.  They, as with high elevation/low oxygen exposed Reishi, also showed much higher levels of Agaricin and medicinally significant antibiotic properties, as well.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWestern medicine/FDA is just now starting to catch on to what the ancients knew all along.  Mushrooms make us more complex and healthier.  At least the process is heading in the right direction and Mycophobia in our country is being depleted on a daily basis.  Knowledge is power rings true more than ever ;).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am posting this species as Ganoderma resinaceum due to the fact that macroscopically it does not have the Characteristics of true G. lucidum and more in line with G. resinaceum group(velvety and minutely hirsute-not strictly varnished and glabrous as with true G. lucidum).  Many, many online samples/offers of what is touted to be true G. lucidum actually turn out to be either G. sichuanensis, G. resinaceum or even adulterated/mixed samples containing the extremely common and less desired G. applanatum.  Regardless of if this was correctly labeled to species(by local company \u0026#8220;Myco-up-rrhizal\u0026#8221;), the kit is masterfully and sterile practice packaged and the knowledge base for \u0026quot;Myco-uprizzhal\u0026#8217;s team is correctly intentioned and the company deserves due praise and business;both here in Olympia, WA and worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope to update this post with growth monitoring, subsequent dehydrating and hopefully a few shots of tea and preparations over the next few weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNOTE: This species does not naturally occur here in Washington State, however I am adding it too my ongoing \u0026#8220;Medicinal Mushrooms Of Washington State\u0026#8221; species list because I plan to inoculate a local, living Alnus rubra with the mycelial mass/cake after I harvest the fruiting bodies.  Will hope to monitor that process and development, as well if possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE IS NO PERSONAL WEBSITE FOR Myco-up-rrhizal-but I am attaching the Oly Farmer\u0026#8217;s market page with listed company\u0026#8217;s in an attempt for those interested to contact them for business.

Thanks again to expert Ganoderma specialist, Matthew Schink for his continued advice and helpful information/support.  We have assisted one another now for over 5 years and on an annual basis share our passion for fungi and knowledge base with countless groups of aspiring amateur mycologists and experts in the field on both MO and multiple FB forums.  He is also an expert farmer/grower and is a vast resource for growing and farming methods(another fact that I am appreciative of and love that we share.  I feel truly blessed to get to share my love for all creation and most importantly people and fungi with this wise, young man.  Daily O2 exposure for approximately 3 hours in the AM to promote slow, dense growth of fruiting bodies and combat mold proliferation and or insect infestation.  Once harvested, I plan to inoculate a local living(albeit, stressed) Alnus rubra or Acer macrophyllum and monitor progress.  Multiple locations near TESC campus house perfect examples for monitoring by Mycology programs at TESC in the future(once inoculation is established).  I plan to submit applications to the dean in the future for this very purpose.  A \u0026#8220;hands on\u0026#8221; foraging, identification and Myco-farming program that will hopefully be installed, offered and maintained permanently as a BS in Mycology curriculum for the school(as currently, and in the past only 4 credit programs have been offered intermittently to the detriment of hundreds of local and students abroad).  I have submitted these requests multiple times in the past.  But by prayer and petition I believe that the body of work I have accumulated over the over 10 years of devotion to the field of mycology will finally be recognized for my knowledge base to reach many, many more students in the future.  My book \u0026#8220;Fungal Freedom-A Guide To Wild Mushrooms Of Washington State\u0026#8221; being the primary text for local Washington fungi(in addition to countless texts that are well known and easily accessible).  Will continue t monitor this growth and post the harvest and subsequent dehydration methods I use for Ganoderma as time passes and growth increases to full maturity.  As with all varnished Ganoderma, the ideal time for harvest is after the caps have planed and flattened, the spore dispersal has occured(and electrostatically covered said caps), and the leading, white growth edge is no longer \u0026#8220;marshmallowy\u0026#8221; and visible.  If local PNW\u0026#8217;ers ar monitoring G. oregonense this summer the same rule of thumb applies and should be exercised.  That being said, if you wish to try eating Ganoderma for culinary purposes they can also be harvested in the white, marshmallow stage and chewed easily.  The sweet, slightly bitter \u0026#8220;drying paint\u0026#8221; like aroma and flavor are never forgotten and certainly an acquired taste which most who have tried them will admit becomes familiar and addictive.  More to come soon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUPDATED 5/26/18:\u003cbr /\u003e\nImages added of the \u0026#8220;nick spots\u0026#8221; already completely(or nearly completely) healing over from two days ago.  By the evening of the 24th the tiny knife slices I enacted(to show and test guttation color as a key to possible species,macroscopically) were already closing shut and \u0026#8220;fluffing\u0026#8221; as I like to call it when polypores form rapid, new growth around a stressed area, or as many of you know completely grow around branches or living leaves in the wild.  This is certainly a very healthy, strong strain and I look forward to inoculating a wild substrate(either red alder or big leaf maple) at the end of the first fruiting here in Olympia,WA soon.  More updates to come-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUPDATE ON 6/5/18.  See notes beneath images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIRST FLUSH HARVEST DATE 6/28/18- Harvested all fruiting bodies(as spore collection on caps and planing of fruiting body caps is uniform-for the most part).  Dehydrating the harvest and re-sealed the bag with approximately a half cup of sterilized water for another harvest.  Mycelium is still vibrantly white on the mycelial mass/grow block.  Will hope to update shots of new flush in the next three weeks :).  SEE ADDED IMAGES OF HARVEST AND RE-SEALING METHOD BELOW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUPDATE ON 9/11/18: 2nd flush of mature fruiting bodies harvested.  See notes under added images in side bar.  Poured approximately half a cup of pre-boiled(and cooled, obviously) H2O and tightly sealed the bag against the grow block, yet again, for another flush attempt.  My goal was to get a 12 month sustained grow from this single block, but may succumb to mold and other pathogens before succeeding.  Either way, 6 months to the day from the companies initial inoculation is more than unheard of for single kits, at least following conventional methods of \u0026#8220;airing and spraying\u0026#8221; methods, rather than my oxygen deprivation and sterilization/soak technique.  Both work, but one gets far longer lasting results.  My hope is that next time folks purchase grow kits that they attempt this method and see for themselves the use in it-at least for polypore species(such as Ganoderma, Trametes and Grifola spp.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9/13/18: Aggressive mycelium has already networked and covered the wounds and harvest locations where I removed fruiting bodies two days ago.  See images added in side bar.  Just as with bark mulch or on logs where harvest occurs in natural outdoor settings, the mycelium of the organism will rush to heal wounds where damaged and most often will be the site of new fruiting bodies(mushrooms) in the future.  This is generally true for all saprophytic and parasitic species of basidiomycetes.  Will continue monitoring and hope that pathogens don\u0026#8217;t overrun the fruiting block as mushroom/mold season begins.  Fingers crossed.\u003cbr /\u003e\n10/2/18-UPDATE OF FLUSH#3:  New flush of primordial growth has formed stems(standard red/yellow tones of most young varnished Ganoderma species) where last flushes fruiting bodies were removed.  This same phenomenon occurs on wild substrates(logs/dead wood.etc.) in natural habitats during summer months.  Will continue to let air exposure occur in short durations each week to combat pathogens(mold/bacteria) from infecting the substrate. \u003cbr /\u003e\n10/30/18: FINAL UPDATE/POST:  Flush#3 harvested and photographed due to the mycelium beginning to finally succumb to slight mold infection. After nearly 8 months of growth from initial inoculation and 3 flushes of harvested and dried fruiting bodies, I think it was time.  I kept the air exposure low, the exposure to sunlight high throughout the grow process and gave regular waterings of pre-boiled \u003cacronym title=\"not bottle sprays\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eH2O\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/acronym\u003e to achieve multiple healthy flushes without infection.

When dry and growing on brown, rough tree bark it requires some attention to be spotted. When damp, after rain, it becomes olive green and shinier and hence quite conspicuous. It is a widely distributed all over the world and on many places a common lichen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHabitus of the find seems quite convincing for Melanelixia subaurifera. Optional similar species Melanelixia subargentifera was abandoned because I was able to find neither tiny cortical hairs toward lobe margins and ends (Ref.1) nor purine on the thallus (Ref.5). The lichens were not found on tree\u0026#8217;s trunk or at the base of it (Ref.2), but rather on small twigs, which doesn\u0026#8217;t match to Melanelixia subargentifera. However, Melanelixia can be easily confused also with brown species of Xanthoparmelia species. Morphological differences are small, however, chemistry is different. My determination is not completely reliable because no chemical tests have been done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaming of this species is also to some extent questionable. Index Fungorum keeps the name Melanelixia subaurifera as a synonym of \u0026#8216;current name\u0026#8217; Melanelia subaurifera, while MycoBank claims the opposite.
