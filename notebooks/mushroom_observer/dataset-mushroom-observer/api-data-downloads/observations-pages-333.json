Multiple young and mature Thuja plicata in addition to the young P. menziesii beneath the massive mother at the top of hill. Multiple images of all 4 separate flowers added to this post(in addition to the mature mother tree and habitat). Will add images in Fall months(beginning in September) of possible fungal associate images and possibilities(Thelephoraceae members fruiting within my created 50m transect).\u003cbr /\u003e\nUPDATE ON 6/9/19:  Found a new flowering location(6th total thus far) across the trail from the original sites that were just above the beach sands at Priest point park while walking with my son and wife.  Yet again, this location was within about 50 feet of an uphill, massive Douglas fir that had the distinctive multilayered, fire proof bark of a 150+ year old tree(mother tree).  Other trees between the mother and Phantom orchid flowering location were young Doug firs, Western red cedars and Madrone.  I carefully harvested multiple seed pods and am mailed pollen samples to fellow naturalist Stewart Wechsler for him to hand pollinate one of the sections of his C. austiniae population at Lincoln park in Seattle, WA with my Priest point park collection pollen.  As a continued study we will test and see how the introduced sections perform in seasons to come and may complete the same procedure(vise versa) here in sections of my transect if it is indeed successful with the Lincoln park lot next and following seasons.  As mentioned previously, I will no doubt add a coinciding observation with herbarium collection of mycorrhizal species that occur within the transect in coming seasons(late the summer and onward).  Stewart mentioned that he has had multiple Amanita species in his phantom orchid flowering vicinity(at the Lincoln park sites), but never successfully Thelephora(earth fans).  Hopefully my transect will prove fruitful and we can have tangible evidence of fruiting mycorrhizal species to add to the greater knowledge and research regarding these beautiful mycoheterotrophic orchids and their sympathetic fungal partners-in association with mature Douglas firs, Western red cedar and vine maple. Multiple images/thumbnails added of the two new flowers on 6/9/19.\u003cbr /\u003e\nUPDATE 6/11/19: Mailed multiple harvested/dried samples of pollinia from this observation/collection to Stewart Wechsler for addition/pollination of his flowering C. austiniae populations at Lincoln park in Seattle, WA.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2822,"consensus_id":28305,"consensus_name":"Cephalanthera austiniae","location_id":1595,"location_name":"Squaxin Park, Olympia, Thurston Co., Washington, USA","primary_image_id":1042501},{"id":368759,"type":"observation","date":"2019-06-02","latitude":"40.5572","longitude":"-74.8378","altitude":60,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.847342,"created_at":"2019-06-08T22:07:41.000Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T13:41:43.000Z","number_of_views":22,"last_viewed":"2023-08-11T19:57:22.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eResupinate odontoid cream crust, with capitate cystidia and lagenocystidia with incrustations at tip.
