Particularly the green ones are very conspicuous. There are 15 species of this genus known in Slovenia (Ref.6). When thali are not well developed, or sterile, without apothecia, or dry their determination to species level may not be an easy task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeltigera horizontalis is relatively rare lichen in Slovenia. Horizontal, roundish apothecia is the dominant distinguishing trait. However, white underside, interwoven with almost black mesh of veins and distinctive fasciculate (in tight bundles of fibers, particularly toward their ends) rhizines are also important in determination.
