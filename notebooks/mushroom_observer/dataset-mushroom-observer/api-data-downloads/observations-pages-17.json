These are very large fungi. largest measuring up to nine inches. The pitures are two that are a little smaller pileus 6.5 inches. Here are my observations. Pileus Fibrilose, with different shades of brown most of the fungi present had depressed caps, one I found presumably younger was some what umbonate. It is included in the pictures Also the younger specimen had a tinge of violate around the outer edge. Lamallae appeared to be crowded emarginate and brown, except in the one specimen that appeared to be younger, They are violet on the outer one third decreasingly less vivid as you got closer to the stipe. Stipe on all are very large 1.5-2.5 inches depending on how large the specimen is. All Stipes are fibrillose 5-9 inches long. And for the most part brown. I have believe some of this coloring might be due to extreme amount of spore present. The Top of the Stipes on quite a few of the Fungi are the same violet as the younger speciment is. In the picture you can also see a large knob at the end of one. Spore color is light brown possibly ocher to cinnamon. And there was spore everywhere. Huge amounts. The taste of this mushroom was mild very mushroomy. In fact I would have to say it was great. If I knew it was safe I would of ate the whole darn thing. I would also like to add there were at least five other kinds of gilled fungi growing under this tree. I believe this could be some kind of cortinarius, but my skills are limited. Any help with this identification would be appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have another question. I understand the process of testing probable edibles in the wild in survival situations. Would that process apply to mushrooms as well. The last step you take (if it passes two prior tests) before being considering something is safe to eat is taking a small bite and waiting 8 hours after ingestion. If no ill efects then it is probably safe to eat. Would this process work with mushrooms as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone suggested ponderosus, but the stipe does not seem thick enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitar, is the Korn mushroom ponderosus as well.

These boletes (from two or three different collections) agree very well with the descriptions given for B. bicolor throughout the literature.
