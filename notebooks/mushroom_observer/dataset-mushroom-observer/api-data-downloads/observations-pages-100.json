Brownish pustules will develop beneath the leaves of the plant it infects. It will persist through winter on the host and reinfect new tissue when available. The spores are wind dispersed. A major property of this rust is that it\u0026#8217;s microcyclic (teliospores are the only binucleated spore stage in the life cycle).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProper sanitation is key to preventing hollyhock rust. There is a strong association between the time a leaf is wet and infection. Ensure adequate air circulation so that your plants can dry and leave space between your plants. If your plant gets infected, remove the infected leaves and burn them.
