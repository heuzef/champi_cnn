He cut it off the trunk with a handsaw.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“The biggest half fell in the water,” said Whitmore, 19, of Kansas City, North.\u003cbr /\u003e\nBut the smaller piece was so heavy he could barely carry it to his pickup a mile away. It weighed 56 pounds on a scale at a grocery in Maysville.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAfter checking the Internet, he knew this humongous fungus was a sulfur shelf mushroom, the “chicken of the woods,” named for its good eating qualities.\u003cbr /\u003e\nGuinness World Records on the Internet lists the largest edible fungi as a giant puffball weighing 48 pounds, 8 ounces.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhitmore said he was undecided about whether to weigh his mushroom again and submit it to Guinness. He can tell by lifting that it has lost some moisture weight since it was cut.\u003cbr /\u003e\nA Missouri Department of Conservation employee measured it Tuesday morning at 30 inches wide and 16 inches from top to bottom.\u003cbr /\u003e\nOne expert who has studied this type of mushroom for 38 years was impressed.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“That’s the biggest sulfur shelf mushroom I’ve ever seen, period,” said Harold Burdsall, 64, a retired U.S. Forest Service fungus expert in Madison, Wis.\u003cbr /\u003e\nBurdsall was looking at photographs of Whitmore’s find sent to him by e-mail.\u003cbr /\u003e\nReference books list the biggest sulfur shelf at about 20 inches wide, said James W. Kimbrough, an expert on molds, mildews and mushrooms at the University of Florida. The scientific name is Laetiporus sulphureus.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt’s doubtful anyone has a reliable record book for individual mushroom species, the experts said.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“But that’s got to be among the largest ever found in North America,” Kimbrough said.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAs a bonus, this type of mushroom tastes great, Burdsall said, with a firm texture and plenty of flavor.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“If there are two wild mushrooms on the table, I’d always take that one, even over morels,” he said.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhitmore’s trophy probably took about two weeks to grow, boosted by plentiful autumn rains and moist, cool conditions.\u003cbr /\u003e\nA mushroom is similar to an apple growing on a tree, only the mushroom is connected to a fungus that has been living in the tree’s core for decades, Burdsall said.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“That maple has a nasty heart rot to produce a mushroom that size,” he said.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhitmore said the part of mushroom that fell into the creek was a larger clump growing on top of the one he saved. He said the water was too cold and deep to retrieve it. But on Tuesday, he pondered the record possibilities lost.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“It might have weighed 120 pounds altogether,” he said.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhitmore was planning to eat a chunk that broke off in his trunk. But he could not decide whether to keep his mammoth mushroom as a trophy or sell it to the highest bidder.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I hunt and fish,” he said, “but this is the best thing I ever got, a real trophy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently also mentioned on the Martha Stewart Show and an unnamed Toronto radio station.

En un comunicado, la institución reportó que el mes pasado personal del Ecosur halló un hongo gigante en Las Cabañas, Cantón Providencia, municipio de Tapachula, a unos kilómetros de la frontera con Guatemala. Trabajadores de la línea Manejo Integrado de Plagas, que realizaban una práctica de campo en el lugar, fueron informados por pobladores de la región sobre la existencia del hongo gigante. Al acudir y ver sus dimensiones, reportaron el hallazgo al personal de la línea Hongos Tropicales de la misma institución. El curador de la colección micológica del Ecosur, René Andrade, viajó con otras personas al lugar para colectar el hongo, particularmente sobresaliente por su tamaño y su poca frecuencia en México. Según el informe, el hongo pesa más de 20 kilogramos, tiene una altura y diámetro de 70 centímetros en ambos casos. El hongo fue trasladado a la sede del Ecosur en Tapachula para ser estudiado; los especialistas determinaron que se trata de una especie que ya había sido encontrada anteriormente en Chiapas. Agregó al respecto que ya tienen dos ejemplares más de esa especie vegetal, uno de ellos de 50 centímetros de diámetro (colectado en fragmentos). El otro espécimen fresco medía 25 centímetros de diámetro. Su nombre científico es Macrocybe Titans Pegler, Lodge y Nakasone y es sinónimo de Tricholoma cistidiosa Cifuentes y Guzmán. Dicha especie fue reportada como nueva para México en 1981, dentro del Parque Educativo Laguna de Bélgica, municipio de Ocozocuautla, también en Chiapas. De acuerdo con el Ecosur, hay reportes que indican la presencia de este hongo también en áreas de Guatemala, Costa Rica y Brasil. La institución añadió que no hay informes que refieran que la especie encontrada sea comestible o nociva. Aparentemente su función en la naturaleza es reciclar la materia orgánica de la misma forma que los demás organismos de su reino. El hongo gigante pasó a formar parte de la Colección Micológica de Ecosur, la cual está integrada por más de cinco mil ejemplares de hongos de diferentes partes del estado de Chiapas, especialmente del Soconusco. Integra ya también los registros del padrón de colecciones de la Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad (CONABIO). La Colección Micológica del Ecosur, que resalta por su ubicación en una zona tropical húmeda, se mantiene con fines de investigación y de docencia y como un apoyo importante para el conocimiento de la biodiversidad de México.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDates inferred from time-stamps, though this may only pertain to one of the two collections, provided they are, in fact, distinct.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":181,"consensus_id":6023,"consensus_name":"Macrocybe titans","location_id":8388,"location_name":"Chiapas, Mexico","primary_image_id":374325},{"id":147859,"type":"observation","date":"2013-09-28","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69834,"created_at":"2013-10-10T19:42:19.000Z","updated_at":"2015-07-27T02:32:50.000Z","number_of_views":27,"last_viewed":"2023-11-22T00:16:39.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound by others at SFSU Bio800 field trip weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFound in mixed conifer forest.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":120,"consensus_name":"Pholiota velaglutinosa","location_id":27,"location_name":"Bassetts, Sierra Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":374296},{"id":147860,"type":"observation","date":"2013-09-28","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.859125,"created_at":"2013-10-10T19:43:37.000Z","updated_at":"2013-10-10T19:45:04.000Z","number_of_views":83,"last_viewed":"2024-01-17T01:17:35.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound in mixed conifer forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find this up in the Sierras most years where I visit them in the fall.
