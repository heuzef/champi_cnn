And that one doesn\u0026#8217;t have a staining reaction.

The divisions are 2.5 microns in the scale.  The spores have a funny staining reaction, it looks like some stain red-brown, some lightly reddish, and some not at all.  The ones not staining seem to be the attached ones, so it looks like that spores only stain in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s when mature.  Does this happen?

The divisions are 1 micron in the scale.  The spores show a germ pore is present.  A few in this photo are in focus enough to see the apiculus, off-center at one end, and the small germ pore, centered at the other end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth image is of the pileipellis (the surface of the cap), and this was mounted in KOH, and taken at 400\u0026#215;.  The grey color of the surface cells can be seen here slightly, and the cap trama cells are thicker without color (at the bottom of the image).  The pileipellis here looks to be a cutis form to me, but like I said I\u0026#8217;m new at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had an e-mail from Else Vellinga about this, and she told me to look for the germ pore and if it has a cutis.

But this happened pretty often, you would wave a mushroom under his nose, and he would spout a name, and some detail about the thing.

I was inspired to look back at these from the Fall 2007 edition of Mushroom, the journal.  This edition has a nice photo of these, in fact, it is exactly this photo of these!  He took this photo and used in the mag.  There the editor named these A. avellaneus which is going further than I had, so I thought it would go back to these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn most books/keys for these you would get to A. ovinus, but the shape, mostly all white/off-white color, and fruity odor doesn\u0026#8217;t really march.  The Pacific NW key to Polypores has a note for A. ovinus that there is A. avellaneus, and you can tell the difference in that the spores are 5-5.5 in length, where A. ovinus spores are 3.5-4 um in length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;ve added a micro-shot here, which is of the inside of a pore at 1000x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  In this shot there is a basidia, and it is 4-spored, and the spores are amyloid.  Looking at 6 spores the ave. size is length  4.58 +/- 0.22, width 4.06 +/- 0.17.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found somewhere in a publication for A. citrina (or something like that) that A. ovinus spores are inamyloid and that A. avellaneus are amyloid, but I can\u0026#8217;t seem to find that ref. now.  Also in the Pacific NW key there is a note (crypticly), that A. subrubescens has amyloid spores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spore size here is a little small for A. avellaneus, but it large for A. ovinus.  Given the area (coastal Humbolt Co.), shape, look, odor, and amyloid spores, I\u0026#8217;m going with A. avellaneus.

I think I have an id on these.  At least it keys out with some assumptions\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the main feature turns out to be the shape of the cheilocystidia.  This is shown in the second micro-shot, which is a gill part (they kinda broke up when I was trying to mount a slice), at 400x under Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The yellow cells are the basidia stained by the Meltzer\u0026#8217;s, but the clear cells are the cystidia.  They are long, with a thin midsection, and a round bulb at the end.  The bulb makes the cystidia \u0026#8220;capitate\u0026#8221;, and this shape with the long thin section before the bulb was called \u0026#8220;tibiiform\u0026#8221; (which I have no idea what that means\u0026#8230;).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the first micro-shot is of the spores, this is at 400x under Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The ave spore size for this guy was measures as 10.0 \u0026#215; 5.8 microns, using 10 spores.  The spores should be roughened, in Galerina is genus is defined by the spores being covered with a tight \u0026#8220;sack\u0026#8221; that wears away in age.  This sack breaking up creates a loose rough surface to the spores, and a \u0026#8220;plage\u0026#8221;, a smooth spot on the end where the sack has completely pulled away.  These spores don\u0026#8217;t show much roughness, or any distinct plage, but this is common in Galerina, where the sack doesn\u0026#8217;t break up much.  Also there was no evidence of a germ pore, or I should say a germ pore was not observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys were found in a swampy deep moss covered area, which also seems to be common for Galerina, and a number of the species are only found here.  This species shows no veil, on the stipe or veil fragments on the cap.  The cap will be light tan to ocheracious (how ever you spell that), and the stipe should be concolorous with the cap.  There will be deep brown striations most of the way to the center, but will fade as the hygrophanous cap dries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, with all this, it does seem to key out in the monograph as G. tibiicystis.  Which seems to be one of the more common Galerina without a veil in moss covered swampy areas.  The only differences from the description is that the spore should be more roughened, here they were only slightly marbled at 1000\u0026#215;.  And the stipe in the shots at the site show the stipe to lighter then the cap, and the cap to be more yellow.  But the shots at home against white paper show the tan colors, and stipe to be concolorous.
