Agarikon is powerful medicine and will continue to be appreciated as disease fighting protection for all living mammals as future generations struggle to figure out how to fight disease., I believe Agarikon, Reishi, Hericium, Polyozellus multiplex and turkey tails will all lead the way in that specific fight. Wherever new disease and bacteria arrive in a substrate( or living human tissue) adaptogenic substances and organisms begin interacting with it, luckily for us the aforementioned fungi have been adapting to and mutating various substrates throughout nature on earth(and I believe we will soon find out space) for approximately 400 million years.  Makes you wonder what a fungi that has lived, and survived the longest of any other(at least as a fruiting body) could possibly do for humans with low or weakened immune systems\u0026#8230;  Of course, Fungi are never the whole story, or cure all (there never is just one!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUPDATE 3/8/2015:  Linked below is my personal collection of done sporulating Agarikon(including the conk in this observation).\u003ca href=\"http://mushroomobserver.org/200148?q=2WgWT\"\u003ehttp://mushroomobserver.org/200148?q=2WgWT\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2822,"consensus_id":6043,"consensus_name":"Laricifomes officinalis","location_id":2484,"location_name":"Mud Bay Rd. near Yauger Way, Olympia, Thurston Co., Washington, USA","primary_image_id":147272},{"id":67824,"type":"observation","date":"2011-05-21","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.50253,"created_at":"2011-05-22T04:22:10.000Z","updated_at":"2011-05-22T04:22:12.000Z","number_of_views":41,"last_viewed":"2024-02-03T02:20:07.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFruiting singularly (on trail side) beneath alder trees in the grass.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2822,"consensus_id":153,"consensus_name":"Mycena acicula","location_id":2484,"location_name":"Mud Bay Rd. near Yauger Way, Olympia, Thurston Co., Washington, USA","primary_image_id":147276},{"id":67825,"type":"observation","date":"2011-05-21","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.64213,"created_at":"2011-05-22T04:26:59.000Z","updated_at":"2012-04-16T22:57:31.000Z","number_of_views":69,"last_viewed":"2023-09-13T10:00:11.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eSmall firm specimens- \u0026#8220;mica\u0026#8221; dust atop caps is very evident when young(hence the given name C.micaceus).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the base of dead stumps on trail side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemp: mid 50\u0026#8217;s light rain.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2822,"consensus_id":28843,"consensus_name":"Coprinellus sect.
