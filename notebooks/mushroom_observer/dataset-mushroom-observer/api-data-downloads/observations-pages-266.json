I have been monitoring this, and multiple of other Thurston County, WA spots from mid October to present(as I do each season) and, as with all species of fungi this season the fruitings have all been delayed(nearly a month or more in some cases for some species-eg- Amanita muscaria subs. flavivolvata).  I usually collect/photograph at this specific spot first as it is the earliest to flush.  I am predicting large flushes throughout Thurston county in the coming weeks at all other spots(granted we don\u0026#8217;t get a heavy frost/killing frost).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNOT fruiting in alder woodchips(Cyan\u0026#8217;s favorite food of choice), but beneath Douglas fir and big leaf maple in coniferous(dark-fibrous) mulch.  These spots I always like to call \u0026#8220;naturals\u0026#8221; because they have been normalized to the environment and are not contingent specifically on alder chips.  I have successfully inoculated many coniferous/wooded bark trails in prior seasons with collections of P. cyanescens that were originally harvested from alder mulch, but then bagged and incubated with brown paper/cardboard mix and \u0026#8220;microwave sterilized\u0026#8221; woodchips until proliferated with hyphae/mycelium.  Buried intentionally in needle duff and coniferous litter after 1.5month incubation.  I am attaching an old observation of cyans that we inoculated using this system.  They actually ended up consuming and fruited directly from Doug fir needles the next season(only one flush and one season occurrence from that habitat).  Always worth experimenting with differing substrates for not only cyanescens, but many other species, as well.
