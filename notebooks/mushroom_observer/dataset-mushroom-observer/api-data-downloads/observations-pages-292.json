The fungus belongs to ascomycetes. Sexual form looks like numerous black dots on bark of some deciduous trees. Most often it is seen on Fagus.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAcervuli of the anamorph form are conspicuously saffron-yellow to orange and of quite different form. Conidia comes from beneath the bark in the form of highly gelatinous \u0026#8216;tooth paste\u0026#8217; squeezed through tiny cracks in the bark. These tendrils and ribbons, sometimes of quite bizarre form (see Ref.4.) are essentially without internal structure under the microscope and consist of jelly like mass crowded with zillions of very thin, strongly curved (sometimes up to the form of half circle) conidia. After rain these tendrils dissolve and disappear completely from the bark surface. If one puts a piece of such infected branch in a small amount of water, the water becomes milky orange after a while. Under the microscope a single drop of this \u0026#8216;solution\u0026#8217; shows astonishingly numerous conidia. This fungus is a common invader of drought damaged Fagus sylvatica and could well be involved in the death of the bark (Ref.6). Allegedly this is the first record of anamorph form of this species in Slovenia (at least according to Ref.5.).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":18508,"consensus_name":"Libertella faginea","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":903032},{"id":326148,"type":"observation","date":"2018-08-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.57294,"created_at":"2018-08-07T09:38:43.000Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T09:55:30.000Z","number_of_views":26,"last_viewed":"2024-04-09T09:00:14.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eWell, I don\u0026#8217;t know if we should count this as an observation.

For this reason, I had originally considered Amanita praecox as its identity. But there are several reasons for my doubting these represent praecox: 1. Lack of hemlock in the habitat; 2. Range of spore quotient well exceeds praecox; 3. Occurrence includes springtime but this type also may persist throughout the summer into October (or may disappear in summer and reappear in fall). This year (2018) these did not appear in this location early August. (I checked often June-July.)

Many, many guidebooks only show G. oregonense at full maturity when the fruiting body is uniformly red/purple and most folks(including many mycologists) think that red, yellow and white color zonation indicates G. tsugae.  Nearly all varnished Ganoderma will exhibit these tri colored patterns early in fruiting phase(during early to mid summer months) and will not become the uniform lacquered, Chinese red until full maturity. The old method for species designation using pore size analysis is also faulty and I have gone back and forth with multiple Ganoderma specialists with examples on both sides of the fence that contradict one another in terms of size.  For example, a two foot wide, massive fruiting body with very dense pores(4-6 per mm) and in contrast, very small fruiting bodies(that occur on Spruce in the Hoh and Quinault rainforests that have very large pores(2-3 per mm) that most folks would macroscopically describe as similar in size to classic G. tsugae. Regardless of species identification for varnished Ganoderma(which now can easily be done using gene sequencing/DNA analysis if one is so inclined) we can all agree that each species of Ganoderma known all have myriad health benefits for human and even animal consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have monitored, harvested, analyzed, photographed, bioassayed and studied this species of fungi for nearly ten years straight now and have learned a ton from them(not only visually, but also spiritually from ingesting and making tea with them).  The West coast occurring varnished Ganoderma are almost always going to be G. oregonense, At least in my home state of Washington. Most all occur on Western hemlock(I have only encountered them on Douglas fir two times out of hundreds of encounters over 10 years of research).  They are a valuable resource for immune stimulation and macrophage activity and are an overall panacea(as are all Ganoderma species-worldwide). Even the often taken for granted and very common G. applanatum(artist bracket) has potent medicinal value and is packed w/benefits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINOCULATION:  I have attached images at the lower portion of this post to show what I do with cut stem butts after harvest and slicing for dehydration.
