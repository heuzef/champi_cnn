This was necessary because the standard forward read originating from the ITS1F primer was not enough to capture the extra-long spacer in its entirety (as it turned out later, the ITS locus in this species is a whopping 1440 base pair long, rivaling in length some of longest \u003ccite\u003eLeccinum\u003c/cite\u003e sequences!!!).\u003cbr /\u003e\nHowever, even with the two forward reads providing full coverage of the locus, the final ITS sequence is still missing the first 39 bps of the ITS1 region (due to interference from a tall noise stemming from the PCR purification methodology) and the last 240 characters of the ITS2 region.  Regarding the short ITS2 sequence, while the ITS3 read goes all the way to LSU, it suffers from 3 separate points of heterogeneity in the ITS2 region (in all cases a 1-base frame shift in one of two haplotypes).  Resolution of the haplotypes was stopped shortly after the 2 \u003csup\u003end\u003c/sup\u003e frame shift.

Re-fruiting has already begun and vibrant white primordial growth is covering the cut wound area.  I occasionally use this method, as well.  However, I now find it more beneficial for furthering the species to harvest the entire fruiting body(stem and all) from the substrate and use the harvested stem butts to inoculate new Western Hemlock host logs/trees to insure longer range propagation of the species.  Whoever continues to harvest my monitoring spots in this location year after year has actually helped to make an interesting revelation and topic of conversation regarding propagation and harvesting.  Either way, whether slicing for re-fruiting or completely uprooting and transplanting/inoculating other host trees with the harvested stem butts, the host tree is already fully infected with the living mycelium of the organism and will continue to fruit in the location until all desired food(lignin) has been depleted.  I think using the re-fruit method with younger collections is wise, while full harvest and stem butt transplant is best for nearly or fully mature sporophores(for not only Reishi but other saprophytic and parasitic species).  With ecto-mycorrhizal species this topic is of no concern and the always used metaphor of a \u0026#8220;apple from a tree\u0026#8221; does not effect the mycelium and propagation hypogeously of the organism.  However, as with truffle hunters, it can be a very detrimental practice to tear up soil networks continually in an area and will eventually erase the species from a forest if annually harvested year after year without reintroducing new trees and inoculations every few seasons(e.g. commercial Matsutake hunters in National forests).  With saprophytes such as Ganoderma we can trust that they will always find a way to eat and propagate, regardless of our interference, and often times, because of it.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2822,"consensus_id":407,"consensus_name":"Ganoderma oregonense","location_id":1484,"location_name":"Olympia, Thurston Co., Washington, USA","primary_image_id":915667},{"id":329984,"type":"observation","date":"2018-08-25","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.5684,"created_at":"2018-08-28T18:00:56.000Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T18:03:26.000Z","number_of_views":124,"last_viewed":"2024-04-12T10:10:45.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eLate season primordia began visibly fruiting 8/1/18 due to record temps(90\u0026#8217;s) that persisted beyond average seasonal levels(my estimation).
