The place of this observation is almost in front of my house, where I live. I know this piece of grassland for decades. Yet, I have seen this mushrooms only once \u0026#8211; in 2013. There were several dozens of them appearing again and again starting at the beginning of October until the end of November. Pilei are ephemeral and of similar habitus as in genus Coprinus but vividly lemon to yolk yellow, beautiful particularly when they are young. It is impossible to overlook them in low grass. They are viscid and very delicate.
