Most will have black gills with white edges but occasionally I find some that have caramel colored gills which I suspect might be “sterile” fruiting bodies. Bottoms of the stipes sometimes bruise blue to varying degree. They seem to more readily separate from the lawn/soil in comparison to Panaeolous specimens growing with them and also have a tendency to bring some mycelium and colonized lawn bits with them.
