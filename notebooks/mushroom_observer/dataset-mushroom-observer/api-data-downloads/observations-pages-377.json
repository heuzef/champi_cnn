Discovered nearby a walking trail and 10 meters from a pond in mixed woods litter. Flesh of cap (120mm dia) and stipe (20mm dia 35mm len) is firm and the stipe seems to be softer in the center. I first thought Lactarius or similar but did not evidence milk when sliced. The gills stained brown at the edges and the bruises stained light brown elsewhere. Spore print is white to cream. Taste seemed mealy but I don\u0026#8217;t trust my taste due to sinus damage. Smell is like Pleurotus at the gills but indistinct on fresh broken flesh. I have trudged through the KUO keys on four paths but find little joy for confidence.
