Unfortunately, a gravel road has been built along the south side of the tree and Beringer Winery has build a very large vineyard along the road.  Which means some 20 years ago, serious deforestation has occurred in this area. This tree has undergone some serious stress in the last 60 years of it\u0026#8217;s life. The fruiting body of Agarikon is about 35-40 feet in the canopy of the tree, on a thrown branch.  the fruiting body is about 2-2.5 feet long (tall) and about a foot in diameter.  It is quite large, but not in comparison to other F. officinalis fruiting bodies. The pore surface was fresh and new.  Cutting into it for tissue was surprisingly like cutting into a very thick cake.
