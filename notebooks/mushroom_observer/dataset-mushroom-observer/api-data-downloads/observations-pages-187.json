pilei up to 4.5 \u0026#215; 3 \u0026#215; 0.6 cm, most of them smaller; pilei have gelatinous cutis easily peeling off, surface not sticky; stipe rudimentary or absent, white mycelium present at the point of attachment;

I decided for the latter because of reddish-brown fibers similar to scales on the surface of pilei. The surface was also not slimy. All my finds of Crepidotus mollis up to now have had slimy and glabrous pilei surface. Measured spores are a little longer than usually with Crepidotus mollis var. mollis (see picture 2M), which also speaks in this sense (Ref.:4). But these fibers may eventually be a consequence of a few warm and dry days before I found the pilei, although they didn\u0026#8217;t look dried or weathered. The Crepidotus mollis var. calolepsis is considered a separate species by some authors. They divide it into two varieties Crepidotus calolepsis var. calolepsis (spores 7 to 10 microns long) and Crepidotus calolepsis var. squamulosus (spores 8 to 12 microns long). Spore domensions and hypha without clamps exclude Crepidotus applanatus, which eventually may also be a candidate for this find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Canon G11, 6.1-30mm/f2.8-4.5\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":2091,"consensus_name":"Crepidotus calolepis","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":552526},{"id":214989,"type":"observation","date":"2015-09-01","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.61858,"created_at":"2015-09-01T13:34:38.000Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T14:02:00.000Z","number_of_views":168,"last_viewed":"2023-12-15T19:03:48.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing in hardwoods\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSPORES: (9.24-)9.92-11.12(-12.12) x (4.18-)4.27-4.72(-5.2) μm Q:2.14-2.6 n:20, smooth, cylindrical, having some oil droplets\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":7286,"consensus_id":28300,"consensus_name":"Tylopilus virens","location_id":11741,"location_name":"Tsukuba, Ibaragi, Japan","primary_image_id":552534},{"id":214990,"type":"observation","date":"2015-09-01","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.61934,"created_at":"2015-09-01T14:33:50.000Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T13:22:10.000Z","number_of_views":68,"last_viewed":"2023-10-15T02:28:08.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowning among \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Ophiopogon+japonicus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eOphiopogon japonicus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e on a roadside in the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFLESH: non-staining\u003cbr /\u003e\nSPORES: (9.85-)10.32-11.84(-12.61) x (3.79-)3.93-4.42(-4.76) μm Q:2.48-2.91 n:20, smooth, cylindrical\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":7286,"consensus_id":50748,"consensus_name":"Phylloporus bellus","location_id":11741,"location_name":"Tsukuba, Ibaragi, Japan","primary_image_id":552539},{"id":214991,"type":"observation","date":"2015-06-07","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.74212,"created_at":"2015-09-01T14:59:01.000Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T20:05:15.000Z","number_of_views":41,"last_viewed":"2023-11-13T01:47:58.000Z","owner_id":4186,"consensus_id":42433,"consensus_name":"Neofavolus alveolaris","location_id":4183,"location_name":"Creve Coeur Park, Maryland Heights, St. Louis Co., Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":552540},{"id":214992,"type":"observation","date":"2015-06-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.51512,"created_at":"2015-09-01T15:07:10.000Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T15:08:54.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2024-03-28T01:33:07.000Z","owner_id":4186,"consensus_id":2215,"consensus_name":"Galiella rufa","location_id":1099,"location_name":"Edmund Babler Memorial State Park, St. Louis Co., Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":552542},{"id":214993,"type":"observation","date":"2015-06-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.67678,"created_at":"2015-09-01T15:12:55.000Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T15:13:57.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2024-02-08T09:20:48.000Z","owner_id":4186,"consensus_id":3005,"consensus_name":"Marasmius rotula","location_id":1099,"location_name":"Edmund Babler Memorial State Park, St. Louis Co., Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":552544},{"id":214994,"type":"observation","date":"2015-07-20","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.80019,"created_at":"2015-09-01T15:20:32.000Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T03:14:19.000Z","number_of_views":135,"last_viewed":"2022-09-07T09:48:52.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eElevation about 11,000 feet.

Geoffrey Kibby posted an Amanita that looked exactly like my collection, which we in the Netherlands would call Amanita vaginata. It is assumed to be assocciated with Populus. I have included the conversation Kibby and I had that day (2014-08-07) Now my questions are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs A. simulans indeed an accepted taxon? If so, what should the true A. vaginata look like and what are its ecological preferences (meaning, how are these two taxa distinguished in the field)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKibby answers these questions to a certain level, but the Dutch mycologists (Eef Arnolds and Nico Dam for instance) are sceptical about this matter. I had a conversation over mail with Arnolds, in which he mentioned 90% of the Dutch observations of A. vaginata are found assocciated with Populus and are always more robust than the more slender and fragile collections found in our calcareous Beech forests. If A. simulans were an accepted taxon, 90% of the Dutch A. vaginata would be A. simulans, Arnolds said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence, I would dive into this matter, since if it turns out to be A. simulans, A. vaginata ss.str. is a lot more rare than we initially thought and we would have a new Amanita for the Netherlands!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#8217;s the conversation between Kibby and me on Facebook:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Ted Brown brought in to Kew a wonderful collection of the rare Amanita simulans, a species that prefers Populus as its host, has a rather grey, woolly stem and a very crumbly, friable volva. This is about the third of fourth British record. He found them in Morden, Surrey.\u0026#8221; (Kibby, 2014-08-07)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;ve found this under Populus today.

Contu places simulans in the section ceciliae because of the friable volva, whereas vaginata is in section vaginata .
