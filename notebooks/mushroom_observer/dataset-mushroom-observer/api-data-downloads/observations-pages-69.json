However, spore dimensions and pore shape correspond better to Polyporus arcularious, which is a spring mushroom according to almost all references I found. Krieglsteiner (Ref.(3)) states that transition forms between both are frequent. According to Donk they are named Polyporus brumalis f. subarcularious, Donk, Medded. Nedl. Mycol. Ver. 18-20: 133 (1933). Index Fungorum considers this name as a synonym of P.brumalis. What is the latest word about somewhat ambiguous taxonomy of these two difficult to separate species is unknown to me. Interestingly the mushrooms where completely frozen when photographed, nevertheless after a day at room temperature they sporulated abundantly. Growing in a group of about 25 fruitbodies on a single about 4 m long log. Pileus diameter from 2.5 cm (one inch) to 6 cm (2.5 inch). Flesh tough, when dry very hard.

this a truffle? It was lying on the ground, ventral side up, with a few tiny pieces of itself scattered here and there. It was under a very mature white pine in an area that was cut over for hardwoods 3 years ago. There were two fairly shallow spots (~3-4 cm deep by 10-12 cm diameter) where it looked like something had been digging in the duff. I did not find any other specimens in the area. When I cut it in half it smelled delicious. Kind of rich, spicy, earthy. I have the specimen under refrigeration.
