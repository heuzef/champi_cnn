These beautiful sporophores are at the nearly mature stage(more pithy than pore layered-as you will see in images of the post harvest slicing/dehydration) but are very useful after dehydration for grinding with a coffee grinder and filling \u0026#8216;00\u0026#8217; caplets(the white pithy interior material) for usage during cold and flu season in conjunction with L Argenine and citric acid for absorption and retention of ergosterols.  Keep in mind that a little goes a long way when using all species of Reishi(varnished Ganoderma-such as G.oregonense, G.lucidum, G.resinaceum, G. neo-japonicum, G. curtisii, G.sessile,G. polychromum,etc).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always,  I harvested these by pulling the entire fruiting body(stem and all) from the substrate.  Most folks will slice them at the base of the stem and encourage a second and even a third flush(which I used to and still occasionally do) but have found that harvesting entire fruiting bodies(stem butts and all) and then slicing of and using said stem butts for inoculation in the pith of other host trees has been a great success and a far greater way to progress the species than to rely on the spore dispersal in a single canopy.  For example, the harvested stem butts from todays collection all went to a host Western Hemlock log out on Cooper Point Road(over ten miles away) that would have never received these spores for infection without my help and assistance.  Reminder-Always try to progress the spread of spores and species when harvesting to ensure that these majestic fungi continue to thrive and expand throughout the planet..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee final images of the stem butt separation method(before bagging and storing/refrigerating) before inoculation.  If you can\u0026#8217;t get them into a new desired host tree/log within 4-6hrs it is imperative that you refrigerate the separated stem butts to keep the mycelium healthy and fight against pathogens/infection and the possibility for a failed transplant of the strain.  Of course you can always inoculate a home grow kit using fresh material, as well.  \u0026#8220;Cultivating Mushrooms\u0026#8221; by Stephen Russell is the best and most concise book on home growing I

It was a button, and looked quite like a Horse Mushroom to me (Agaricus sect. Arvenses). I saw it again on Thursday, the next day I went to my office. It was full grown then, and still looked like an Agaricus, in particular A. crocodilinus which is a common species around here. So, when I popped it out of the ground I was astonished to see the pure white gills. My first thought was \u0026#8220;Leucoagaricus\u0026#8221;, although the annulus looked wrong and the stalk lacked the clavate shape associated with L. leucothites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFruit body is post-mature, and there\u0026#8217;s been excessive rainfall in the area. So, features may be somewhat anomalous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStipe base appears to include sheathing appressed material that I take to be volval remains. Stipe with fluffy/floccose deposits below the annulus and down to the base. Stipe buried in the soil less than 2 cm deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContext is fairly fragile throughout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCap is deeply cracked, basically whitish with some darkening near the disc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnulus is skirtlike with upper surface striate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdor is nauseating. One person described it as \u0026#8220;like rotting crab meat\u0026#8221;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpores are amyloid, shapes variable, globose, subglobose, broadly ellipsoid (a few verging on ellipsoid), 8-10 \u0026#215; 7-8.5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHabitat: a lawn that had not been mowed for awhile (due to persistent rainfall). There are a few small ornamental trees (Carpinus) and shrubs in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026#8217;t think to apply KOH to the cap. However, this does not strike me as representing section Phalloideae. (I could still test the dried material.) Except for the lack of brown deposits on the cap surface and presence of a well-developed annulus, this appears to match the description of A. nauseosa. The spores were amyloid, but not particularly strongly so. I got a decent spore print and added a drop of Meltzer\u0026#8217;s. At first I didn\u0026#8217;t notice much darkening, but under the scope amyloidity was clear. Then, some of the Meltzer\u0026#8217;s leaked from under the slip and reacted with spore mass that had piled up near the edge of the slip, clearly blackening those spores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made it a point to keep this in the dehydrator a few hours longer than usual. The material was originally quite moist. Also, my understanding is that the saprobic Amanita fruit bodies are particularly prone to absorbing moisture from the air. The stipe base was partially broken upon extraction. If I had any idea what this may be, I would have been more careful!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after all of this\u0026#8230; probably just a Destroying Angel :-(\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":667,"consensus_id":25243,"consensus_name":"Amanita sect.
