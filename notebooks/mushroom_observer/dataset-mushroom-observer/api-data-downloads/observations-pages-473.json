nestled between and emerging from a piece of rotting wood under small 1-2 in. rocks in a small cluster, in the front yard behind a shed.

Mushroom appeared short on the surface but the entire fruiting body, once excavated was much longer than what was above ground. Caps are mostly red and orange with a slight nipple. Very ends of are cream or beige colored. Has a distinctive smell. No rings found/noticed. Gills are widely-spaced w/ adnexed hymenium. Stems have variating splotches of dark orange and and beige and are serpentine in form. Does not have enough similarities to poisonous Jack-O-Lantern species or a False Chanterelle.
