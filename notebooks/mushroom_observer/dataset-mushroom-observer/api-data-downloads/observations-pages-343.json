Growing abundantly in swampy soil in a hardwood forest. Acer spp., Quercus spp., Ulmus spp., Carya spp., Fagus grandifolia, Ostrya virginiana and other hardwoods present in the area. Caps and stems dry. Caps finely areolate at maturity. Young pores dull red, becoming dull yellow with some red remaining on the tube mouths closest to the stem. Pores short-decurrent, not bruising noticeably and not stuffed when young. Stems with reddish punctae and reticulation, and with white basal mycelium attached to white rhizomorphs. Context white throughout, slowly bruising sky blue, and with yellow discoloration in holes made by insect larvae. Odor not distinctive. 10% NH4OH neutral on the cap and context. 1M KOH dark reddish-brown on the cap and light rusty brown on the context. FeSO4 dull brown on the cap (weakly reacting) and light olive brown on the context. Pileipellis hyphae with encrusting pigment. Clamps lacking in the pileipellis and in the hymenial trama.
