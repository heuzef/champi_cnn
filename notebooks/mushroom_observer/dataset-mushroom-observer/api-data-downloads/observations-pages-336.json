It consists of a full-length ITS sequence of 487 bps derived from a single (reverse) read and a long fragment of nrLSU (the first 948-949 bps) assembled from a forward (LSU0F) and reverse (LR22) reads.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThere is a single ambiguity, \u0026#8220;R\u0026#8221; (A/G), at the end of the 5.8S sublocus of ITS.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe LSU sequence has one ambiguity at position #238 from the start of the locus and also a single point of heterogeneity at base #463 from the start of the locus.  The second, minor haplotype inserts a \u0026#8220;C\u0026#8221; here.  The haplotypes were resolved manually in the usual fashion by following the predictable frame shift pattern.  The haplotype ratio is on average 2.5:1 based on the estimated area under the curve.  Due to broadening of the peaks, the sequence doesn\u0026#8217;t reach the LR5 primer area by only 47 bases.  The ambiguity was deduced via the peak ratio, as well as by observing that the shorter/major haplotype has a slightly shorter retention time in the LSU0F read that manifests itself in less-than perfect overlap of peaks in the scrambled region.  The peaks of the major haplotype are slightly to the left of the minor haplotype.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe ITS and LSU are uploaded separately and will be submitted in the same fashion to GenBank.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe ITS sequence is 99.6-99.8% similar to 20 RET\u0026#8217;s accessions of \u003ccite\u003eAmanita penetratrix\u003c/cite\u003e.
