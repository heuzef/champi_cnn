It is common in the Trenta valley too. Its thallus is superficial, not immersed into the rock (endolithic) as with many other Verrucaria species and relatively thick (0.3 \u0026#8211; 0.5 mm). From far it looks like a black tar stain frequent on coastal rocks. From close one can see that the thallus is cracked into fine, irregular areoles, which are smaller than 1 mm. In the cracks among them black prothallus can be seen. Some of the areoles show the upper most part of immersed perithecia. When the thallus is wet it looks quite differently. The cracks in the thallus disappear and the perithecia tips look differently than in the dry state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamera: Nikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Sony ILCE6000 / Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar E 16-70 mm/f4\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":14714,"consensus_name":"Verrucaria nigrescens","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":1326356},{"id":452753,"type":"observation","date":"2021-05-03","latitude":"38.0823","longitude":"-78.4559","altitude":139,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.31495,"created_at":"2021-05-06T15:00:12.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T02:24:19.000Z","number_of_views":48,"last_viewed":"2024-02-18T00:49:11.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound on fallen 2.5 cm diameter deciduous branch.

Not sure if the blue will show up in the pictures I took shortly after picking but I have no doubt that it was visible in person.

It belongs to \u0026#8216;Cladonia pyxidata\u0026#8217; group of lichens having trumpet like podetia when not sterile. There are several members of this group not always easy to be determined to species level. They usually have very similar, small ground (primary) squamules. The size, shape, surface of podetia and color of eventually present apothecia or pycnidia are important distinguishing field characters, chemical tests help a lot in confirmation of determinations. Cladonia fimbriata has slender, stout podetia, with relatively shallow cups (abruptly joined to long stalks in mature podetia) with mostly even margins except when fertile having apothecia or pycnidia (in the form of small brown dots \u0026#8211; see Fig. 14). Their surface is allover covered by very small, farinose soredia and sometimes with relatively few, if any, small secondary squamules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamera: Nikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":8629,"consensus_name":"Cladonia fimbriata","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":1328269},{"id":453248,"type":"observation","date":"2021-05-16","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"altitude":170,"gps_hidden":true,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70745,"created_at":"2021-05-16T19:47:30.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T04:34:26.000Z","number_of_views":56,"last_viewed":"2024-03-10T06:06:40.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound this on a decaying log.
