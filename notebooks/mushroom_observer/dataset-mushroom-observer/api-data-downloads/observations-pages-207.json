I interpret this as an indication of how the fruiting of these small forest yellows likely depends upon the relative timing of the trees preparing to foliate, the soil temperature, and moisture level. This year the weather warmed and the tulip poplar started to leaf out, but there was no rainfall for about 10 days.
