Mamede.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAs you will see there is some diversity among the specific target, especially of the genera \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Panaeolus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePanaeolus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Deconica\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eDeconica\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, but other potentially are present, at least judging by the macroscopic characteristics, as \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Bolbitius\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eBolbitius\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Conocybe\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eConocybe\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pholiotina\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePholiotina\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Protostropharia\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eProtostropharia\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e as well as some coprinoid mushrooms (whose genera are more  difficult to distinguish based only on the macroscopic characteristics). Particularly for the genus \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Panaeolus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePanaeolus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e there was a basic question to clarify: although in the past several names have been proposed for some of my observations, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Panaeolus+papilionaceous\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eP. papilionaceous\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e species clearly stands out, and it is not guaranteed that the others belong to different species. Now I can say that there are indeed other species present, since continuing to judge based on macrocopy, some of them have specific characteristics. With the passage of time will have the opportunity to perform some microscopy and then classify with greater assurance the species present.

Bot_927/2015_DSC9883\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHabitat: mixed wood, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, dominant trees with some Larix decidua and Fraxinus excelsior; steep mountain slope, west aspect, however in shade of mountains during winter months; rather cool and humid place; calcareous ground; partly protected from direct rain by tree canopies; average precipitations ~ 3.000 mm/year, average temperature 5 \u0026#8211; 6 deg C, elevation 790 (2.600 feet), alpine phytogeographical region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubstratum: large, very old Fagus sylvatica, the tree is still alive, but fungus is growing on a partly dead part of it, still in bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlace: Zadnja Trenta valley; at the border of Forest reserve Kukla; about 100 m southwest of the memorial of  Dr. Julius Kugy, poet and mountaineer of Julian Alps; near switchback no.48 of Vršič alpine road, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia EC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments: This find has posed very interesting challenges for determination. Several options have been considered but apparently none fit to the find. Experts have been consulted but no definite solution found. Finally a sample has been sent to Dr. Leif Ryvarden, University of Oslo who determined it as Trametes pubescens. Many thanks to all involved in the problem solving \u0026#8211; Dr. Nikica Ogris and Andrej Piltaver, Slovenian Forestry Institute, Bojan Rot, Bovec, Branko Vrhovnik, Horjul and specially to Prof. Ryvarden for his final determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main source of identification problems is probably very untypical shape of the pilei. Trametes pubescens has usually relatively thin pilei. According to the key of genus Trametes given in Krieglsteiner (2000), p585 the pilei are about 0.5 (1) cm thick, Ryvarden (2014), p417 states: \u0026#8220;\u0026#8230; Basidiocarps thin \u0026#8230; context up to 5 mm \u0026#8230; pore layer up to 4 mm thick\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221; and Bernicchia (2005), p535 gives \u0026quot; \u0026#8230; context 3-5 mm and pore layer 1-5 mm thick\u0026#8230; \u0026quot;. The pilei found were up to 5 cm thick and in most cases triquetrous in cross-section. Also spores are significantly longer than normally expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing in a few groups on the same part of a large tree; altogether more than 200 pilei present; majority of them laterally confluent, imbricate, some single; some effuse-reflexed, most of them triquetrous in cross-section; pilei dimensions: 8-10(16) x 4-5(6.5) cm and 2.5-5 cm thick; pore layer up to 8 mm thick; context of very low specific weight, corky, similar to dry Piptoporus betulinus; when dry quite firm, brittle, brakes to pieces; SP scarce, but distinctive (after making pilei moist and at 18-20 deg C), whitish-beige, oac851; fungi causing white root according to analysis of the wood made at the Forestry Institute of Slovenia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Canon G11, 6.1-30mm/f2.8-4.5\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":3844,"consensus_name":"Trametes pubescens","location_id":739,"location_name":"Zadnja Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":594227},{"id":229540,"type":"observation","date":"2015-10-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.68269,"created_at":"2016-01-26T15:21:41.000Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T17:47:27.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2022-09-14T10:43:29.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":5849,"consensus_name":"Amanita muscaria var. guessowii","location_id":1076,"location_name":"Turkey Point, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":594242},{"id":229541,"type":"observation","date":"2015-10-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.68269,"created_at":"2016-01-26T15:23:22.000Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T17:48:11.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2022-09-02T01:37:48.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":5849,"consensus_name":"Amanita muscaria var. guessowii","location_id":1076,"location_name":"Turkey Point, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":594244},{"id":229542,"type":"observation","date":"2015-10-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.873043,"created_at":"2016-01-26T15:29:11.000Z","updated_at":"2019-11-21T14:41:32.000Z","number_of_views":31,"last_viewed":"2022-07-27T21:27:25.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":108106,"consensus_name":"Russula puellaris group","location_id":1076,"location_name":"Turkey Point, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":594246},{"id":229543,"type":"observation","date":"2015-10-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.86777,"created_at":"2016-01-26T16:26:08.000Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T16:26:12.000Z","number_of_views":11,"last_viewed":"2022-10-25T19:43:45.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003espore print yellow-orange\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":22603,"consensus_name":"Russula","location_id":1076,"location_name":"Turkey Point, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":594251},{"id":229544,"type":"observation","date":"2015-10-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.86777,"created_at":"2016-01-26T16:27:25.000Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T16:27:31.000Z","number_of_views":9,"last_viewed":"2022-02-16T00:40:27.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003espore print: yellow-orange\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":22603,"consensus_name":"Russula","location_id":1076,"location_name":"Turkey Point, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":594252},{"id":229545,"type":"observation","date":"2016-01-26","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.34141,"created_at":"2016-01-26T16:38:02.000Z","updated_at":"2021-02-17T16:46:18.000Z","number_of_views":68,"last_viewed":"2023-04-14T01:11:00.000Z","owner_id":550,"consensus_id":58484,"consensus_name":"Lepidostroma rugaramae","location_id":13107,"location_name":"Mufindi, Mafinga, Iringa, Tanzania","primary_image_id":594257},{"id":229547,"type":"observation","date":"2016-01-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69928,"created_at":"2016-01-26T17:05:03.000Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T21:54:35.000Z","number_of_views":165,"last_viewed":"2024-02-18T06:53:25.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing in grass at edge of trail.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4122,"consensus_id":51840,"consensus_name":"Agaricus incultorum","location_id":13126,"location_name":"San Luis National Wildlife Refuge, Merced Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":594258},{"id":229548,"type":"observation","date":"2016-01-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.5385,"created_at":"2016-01-26T17:15:17.000Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T17:15:20.000Z","number_of_views":24,"last_viewed":"2022-01-03T04:45:57.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eIn leaf litter under Willow.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4122,"consensus_id":506,"consensus_name":"Clitocybe nuda","location_id":13126,"location_name":"San Luis National Wildlife Refuge, Merced Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":594260},{"id":229549,"type":"observation","date":"2016-01-25","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.56617,"created_at":"2016-01-26T17:52:02.000Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:16:37.000Z","number_of_views":9,"last_viewed":"2021-12-03T03:56:41.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMACRO‐FUNGI CHECKLIST: SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK\u003cbr /\u003e\nRobert C.
