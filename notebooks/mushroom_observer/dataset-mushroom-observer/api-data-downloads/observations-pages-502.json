( \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/541592\"\u003ehttps://mushroomobserver.org/541592\u003c/a\u003e )\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Caps were more colorful, seemed a bit more damp to the touch.\u003cbr /\u003e\n- There were trees I believe were Coccoloba trees in the vicinity, and also some palm. Previous mushroom didn\u0026#8217;t appear to be near Coccoloba trees. Though I can double check my photos to be sure.\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Soil was sandier here, and we were within eyeshot of the ocean.\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Stipe was beautifully colored, but more uniform. Not the full gradient of Red to Yellow, more a yellow-orange color.\u003cbr /\u003e\n- Raw taste was not spicy, or very mildly spicy. Cooked taste was delicious, not noticeably spicy, very similar to other chanterelle species I have eaten. \u003cbr /\u003e\n- Spore print was also pale/white.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":64390,"consensus_id":59430,"consensus_name":"Cantharellus coccolobae","location_id":26240,"location_name":"Isla de Utila, Islas de la Bahía,
