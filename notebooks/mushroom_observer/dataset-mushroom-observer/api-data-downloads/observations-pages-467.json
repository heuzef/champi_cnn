It\u0026#8217;s a bit hard to key out because it was growing in grass clippings/leaf mulch from a nearby hospital campus, but it was in a beech forest that has quite old trees. There was some red staining, predominately on the stem of more mature specimens, but the staining upon bisection was very very subtle and limited mostly to the outer edges of the stipe\u0026#8217;s interior. Smell is hard to pin down with these \u0026#8211; it is not offensive to me like Xanthodermatai members I\u0026#8217;m familiar with, but it\u0026#8217;s not fragrant almonds like the arvenses / subrufescens I find in similar habitats.

In the dim forest light it seemed to have a greenish yellow glow. I\u0026#8217;ve never seen anything like it before. They felt like firm gel. They were surprisingly tough, and did not smoosh apart when I tried to squish it between my fingers. No distinct smell, besides the general rotting log/fungi/forest smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI intend to go back when it gets warm again to see if these are still growing, but I have no idea if this spot will be the same when I go back, they might have it logged out by then. I can\u0026#8217;t imagine that this fungus will continue to grow in sunny dry conditions that will be created through the logging. All of the descriptions I have read from other observers say it was growing in mesic habitat with shade. There are a lot of fungi and plants in this area that I only ever see in mature/old growth forests and I don\u0026#8217;t expect them to survive the bulldozers, heavy machines and removal of the trees. In this area, these timber sales frequently convert the forest into red maple stump sprouts and invasive species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I ever see one of these again, I will put it in alcohol and send it to one of you all for analysis! I would love to know more about the species. There were lots of other fungi and slime molds around that day too. This is my first time on mushroom observer, and I\u0026#8217;ll try to get more of the things I see on here if possible. I usually post on INat.
