Then I saw these big asci full of spores, more than one hundred for sure.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe next step was difficult: to find, at least to genus, a name for it. Using \u003ca href=\"http://www.lias.net/\"\u003eliaslight.lias.net/\u003c/a\u003e, a very useful tool by the way, I came to the conclusion that it must be a \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Biatoridium\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eBiatoridium sp.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.
