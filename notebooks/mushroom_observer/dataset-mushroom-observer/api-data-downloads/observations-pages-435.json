All found under or attached at base of oak trees. Some with common ground area, however, most in the woods heavy with large old oak, a little maple, and a few beech. Near lake and on mountain/hill. Clusters varied from 3-37 in each cluster. Yellow orange to bright orange with luminous glow when observed at night. Specimens in woods presented with vibrant orange and pale yellow/orange. Specimens in the common park area were more yellow to brownish with faint orange brown tint. Gills are yellow orange to orange and run decurrent. Cap was observed in covert at fruiting, flat at mid life, and appear funnel and wavy at end of cycle. Fruiting specimens had a tan cap with tint of yellow to orange.  Specimens observed in late stage have a burgundy color with blacking along outside edge of the gills. They have a strong smell and slightly bitter taste. Stem is thick and strong with a orange fluid that leaks when cut. Bruising of mostly green, slight brown and bluish to stems.
