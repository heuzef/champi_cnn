Now Ganoderma tsugae seems to exclusively parasitize the Eastern Hemlock which is being wiped out along the East Coast due to the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid an invasive insect.  I have visited this area around this time in 2013, 2017, and now 2018.  In 2013 there were a few samples of G. tsugae found in this forest that was so heavily canopied that in full sun most of my surroundings were in dark shade.  In 2017 the forest was heavily \u0026#8216;thinned\u0026#8217;.  Most trees had barely any needles, but G. tsugae was so abundant I couldn\u0026#8217;t carry all the samples I found if I had a backpack (not that I\u0026#8217;d take that many if I could).  Clearly the Adelgid had devastated this area.  This year almost none of the trees had needles at all and most of them had lost their branches as well with plenty of trees toppled over.  I also found almost NO G. tsugae samples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s clear that in a healthy forest only a few dying trees could host G. tsugae and as the Adelgid drastically weakened the trees G. tsugae began to claim lots of them, but now that they\u0026#8217;re almost all gone there\u0026#8217;s nowhere left for G. tsugae to parasitize.

It grows under oak (a recent find was made by someone else under birch) and has a number of consistent characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTIPE: It always has a pillar stipe that is even from bottom to top. The skin of the stipe is red with yellow streaks but no reticulation. The context within the stipe is yellow with red larval tunnels. It does not stain. Mycelium is white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCAP: The cap starts out the same deep red as the stipe and distinctly rounded. It flattens with age and loses its red color, gradually becoming a nondescript tan with echoes of red in certain spots. The context of the cap can vary from pale yellow to white and does not bruise blue with the possible exception of a faint tint… but that could also be contamination from the pores in older specimens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePORES: The pores start out as a clean, bright yellow that does not bruise at all. The specimen in these photos was also marked with “SPP” but you cannot see it because there was no reaction. The pores slowly darken toward a deeper yellow with age and always gain an array of reddish dots. Older specimens have pores that slowly (5-20 seconds) bruise a grayish blue. That blue resolves to an almost black shade over the course of perhaps 30 minutes, which then fades even more slowly to the brown seen in later photos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSUBJECTIVE: This is not a particularly desirable bolete even in its youth. It has a typical bolete aroma and a mild flavor, but it lacks the density that characterizes other genera even though it has a relatively thin tube layer. There is nothing “bad” about it, but also nothing that would make it an eager target. In a similar way it is vulnerable to bugs but in a middling way. It rarely appears in a thoroughly chewed format, but is equally rarely found totally clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMEASUREMENTS: The largest specimens push 6” in diameter and perhaps 3-4” in height. There were two specimens measured for this observation. The older one was 3” in cap diameter, with a cap that was 3/4” thick. The thickest part of the tube layer was a bit less than 3/8”. The smaller specimen had a cap 1-1/2” in diameter and pores that were no more than 1/32” deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHEMICAL TESTS ON THE MATURE SPECIMEN:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCap Skin w/Ammonia: No reaction\u003cbr /\u003e\nCap Skin w/KOH: Might have darkened, but no clear reaction\u003cbr /\u003e\nCap Skin w/FeSO4: Olive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCap Context w/Ammonia: No reaction\u003cbr /\u003e\nCap Context w/KOH: Orange/pink\u003cbr /\u003e\nCap Context w/FeSO4: Olive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePores w/Ammonia: No reaction\u003cbr /\u003e\nPores w/KOH: Red/brown\u003cbr /\u003e\nPores w/FeSO4: Olive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHEMICAL TESTS ON THE BABY:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCap Skin w/Ammonia: Orange\u003cbr /\u003e\nCap Skin w/KOH: Faded to the tan seen in age\u003cbr /\u003e\nCap Skin w/FeSO4: Olive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCap Context w/Ammonia: No reaction\u003cbr /\u003e\nCap Context w/KOH: Orange/pink\u003cbr /\u003e\nCap Context w/FeSO4: Olive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePores w/Ammonia: Light brown\u003cbr /\u003e\nPores w/KOH: None/pale orange\u003cbr /\u003e\nPores w/FeSO4: Olive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAll chemicals were applied using a soaked Q-tip\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","owner_id":7334,"consensus_id":50316,"consensus_name":"Baorangia bicolor group","location_id":5877,"location_name":"Hartwood Acres Park, Allegheny Co., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":878959},{"id":319017,"type":"observation","date":"2018-06-07","latitude":"36.9905","longitude":"-82.9888","altitude":701,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.82061,"created_at":"2018-06-08T03:46:12.000Z","updated_at":"2018-06-09T02:42:27.000Z","number_of_views":88,"last_viewed":"2023-11-02T06:17:17.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFruiting terrestrially in mixed forest.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":10093,"consensus_id":5801,"consensus_name":"Entoloma incanum","location_id":18020,"location_name":"Kingdom Come State Park, Cumberland, Kentucky, USA","primary_image_id":878973},{"id":319018,"type":"observation","date":"2018-05-21","latitude":"33.9896","longitude":"-83.4956","altitude":229,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.851225,"created_at":"2018-06-08T03:46:20.000Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T03:46:33.000Z","number_of_views":49,"last_viewed":"2024-04-19T04:51:21.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn a barkless pine log.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":7066,"consensus_id":27059,"consensus_name":"Lindbladia tubulina","location_id":11312,"location_name":"Tallassee Highlands, Clarke Co., Georgia, USA","primary_image_id":878980},{"id":319019,"type":"observation","date":"2018-06-07","latitude":"36.9902","longitude":"-82.9891","altitude":708,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70932,"created_at":"2018-06-08T04:11:48.000Z","updated_at":"2018-06-09T15:10:20.000Z","number_of_views":39,"last_viewed":"2023-08-16T17:34:49.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFruiting from wood debris.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":10093,"consensus_id":40337,"consensus_name":"Cyathus sect.
