To find its not yet mature, shaggy,brown fruit bodies in forest ground is almost impossible until one crawls on his knees through the woods. When the fruit bodies open, but are still covered by a whitish scurfy membrane, the chances to notice white small, round circles on ground are at maximum. However, the membrane soon raptures to reveal the \u0026#8216;eggs\u0026#8217; and disappears. The tiny \u0026#8216;eggs\u0026#8217; (spore bearing peridioles), not much more than 1 mm in diameter, and the brown-gray-blackish fruit bodies again become well hidden in ground debris and hard to find. Cyathus striatus can be easily distinguished from other species of this genus growing in Slovenia by its radially striate interior of peridium (wall of the \u0026#8216;nest\u0026#8217;).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing solitary and in small groups of a few fruit bodies, about a dozen fruit bodies found on 1 \u0026#215; 1 m plot. They are of 8-10 mm diameter and up to 15 mm tall. From unknown reason I was unable to get spores although a few sporocarps and their peridioles appear mature and in good shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRef.:\u003cbr /\u003e\n(1) G.J.

Standard books generally consider it growing in all kinds of woods under trees (Ref.:7 and elsewhere). Its Latin species name suggests the same \u0026#8211; \u0026#8216;dryophilus\u0026#8217; means \u0026#8216;oak loving\u0026#8217;. Similarly does its German name \u0026#8211; \u0026#8216;Waldfreund\u0026#8217; means \u0026#8216;friend of woods\u0026#8217;. It is most common in submontane elevations 400-600 m (Ref.: 6.). That is why I was initially reluctant regarding my determination of these fungi found in open stony grassland far of any trees in an alpine phytogeographical region at around 2.000 m (6.500 feet) elevation. Later I realized that the species has been found in similar habitats also at significantly higher elevations than this: in Stubaier Alps, Austria (Ref.: 2) and Italian West Alps (Ref.:5), in Switzerland (Ref. 3), in Pyrenees (Ref.:4) and elsewhere outside of its \u0026#8216;traditional\u0026#8217; habitats, for example in glacier forefront in Scandinavia (Ref. 8). Apparently the species must have a very broad ecological range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing mostly in groups of a few to several fruit bodies.
