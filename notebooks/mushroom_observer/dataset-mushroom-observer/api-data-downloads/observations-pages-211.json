The first measurement of its spores made on live material distinguished it from the most common species in this genus Fuligo septica. Fuligo septica has smaller spores, from 6 to 9 microns in diameter, while most of other species have spores larger than 10 microns in diameter. Also colors of either aethalium (fruiting body formed from all or most of the plasmodium), or of plasmodium (acellular, multinucleate mass of protoplasm, which crawls around, feeds and grows before it forms aethalium), or of inner lime (structure within spore mass of mature aethalium) of this observation fit perfectly to none of the five varieties of Fuligo septica described  in Ref.:3 (namely: F.s. var. septica, F.s. var. flava, F.s. var. candida, F.s. var. rosea and F.s. var. rufa). \u003cbr /\u003e\nUsing the key of the genus Fuligo given in Ref.: 1 one comes straight to Fuligo intermedia Macbr., syn.: Fuligo cinerea var. ecorticata Lister. The measured average spore diameter and spore surface fit best, but not perfect, to this species (pertains to the first measurement of spores). But there are important differences from the descriptions of this species in the literature. For example, cortex (a more or less thick outer layer of an aethalium) is not thin as it should be. Hypothallus (a thin layer between the substrate and fruiting body) was membranous and of several layers (as it should be according to Ref.:1) but it was only locally white. Dominant colors were yellow and even red. According to literature the color of aethalium should be dirty white, pale gray or brownish. This was so only on a rather limited part of aethalium (see pictures 30-32 upper part of the aethalium). Aethalium was mostly black with partly deep reddish tint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dried sample of the find has been analyzed at the Slovenian Forestry Institute by Mrs. Sanja Behrič. Spores have been measured twice (on two sets of equipment). Significantly smaller average dimension (8.5-8.7 μm and 8.8 μm; n \u0026gt; 20) found. This fits well to Fuligo septica. However, the other observed discrepancies from this species remain. A most probable but unverified assumption is that very bad weather with low temperatures during the development of the aethalium caused unusual properties. The quite significant differences in the results of spore dimensions of all three measurements could be the consequence of an uneven development of spore mass in different parts of aethalium, which were analyzed. But this is only an assumption. Because of that a reliable determination of the find remains open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Canon G11, 6.1-30mm/f2.8-4.5\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":789,"consensus_name":"Fuligo","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":628841},{"id":242485,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.87024,"created_at":"2016-06-24T10:58:34.000Z","updated_at":"2016-06-26T02:53:55.000Z","number_of_views":31,"last_viewed":"2022-09-09T00:01:02.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":40890,"consensus_name":"Lactifluus piperatus","location_id":13908,"location_name":"Bedekovcina, Croatia","primary_image_id":628851},{"id":242486,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.6252,"created_at":"2016-06-24T11:01:52.000Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T19:52:52.000Z","number_of_views":26,"last_viewed":"2024-01-29T22:18:45.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":16567,"consensus_name":"Russula chloroides","location_id":13908,"location_name":"Bedekovcina, Croatia","primary_image_id":628856},{"id":242487,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.60868,"created_at":"2016-06-24T11:03:24.000Z","updated_at":"2018-12-01T18:51:08.000Z","number_of_views":20,"last_viewed":"2021-09-28T22:59:28.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":21328,"consensus_name":"Agrocybe molesta","location_id":13908,"location_name":"Bedekovcina, Croatia","primary_image_id":628858},{"id":242488,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.916804,"created_at":"2016-06-24T11:06:11.000Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T19:52:15.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2023-08-03T19:04:32.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":18400,"consensus_name":"Cantharellus pallens","location_id":13908,"location_name":"Bedekovcina, Croatia","primary_image_id":628861},{"id":242489,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.7359,"created_at":"2016-06-24T11:07:25.000Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T11:07:28.000Z","number_of_views":17,"last_viewed":"2023-10-13T08:15:14.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":479,"consensus_name":"Cantharellus","location_id":13908,"location_name":"Bedekovcina, Croatia","primary_image_id":628863},{"id":242490,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.7359,"created_at":"2016-06-24T11:08:30.000Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T11:08:34.000Z","number_of_views":14,"last_viewed":"2023-08-17T04:30:57.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":22603,"consensus_name":"Russula","location_id":13908,"location_name":"Bedekovcina, Croatia","primary_image_id":628865},{"id":242491,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.29658,"created_at":"2016-06-24T11:12:20.000Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T03:56:04.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2021-09-28T22:59:03.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":1431,"consensus_name":"Amanita rubescens","location_id":13908,"location_name":"Bedekovcina, Croatia","primary_image_id":628867},{"id":242492,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70013,"created_at":"2016-06-24T11:13:50.000Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T20:12:37.000Z","number_of_views":29,"last_viewed":"2023-10-13T09:17:04.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":3283,"consensus_name":"Phallus impudicus","location_id":13908,"location_name":"Bedekovcina, Croatia","primary_image_id":628869},{"id":242493,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-16","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.63488,"created_at":"2016-06-24T11:14:56.000Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T16:23:02.000Z","number_of_views":36,"last_viewed":"2023-10-17T16:30:33.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":25240,"consensus_name":"Amanita sect.
