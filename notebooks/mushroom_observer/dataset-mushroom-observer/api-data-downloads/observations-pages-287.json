first I did not think these represented the species Amanita crenulata. The caps feature more yellow than I expect with crenulata, each small specimen had a persistent annulus, and the stipe bases featured more hefty deposits than I generally see with crenulata. In general, the basal bulb of crenulata shows (at most) a pigmented powdery deposit. But, reading the description of crenulata on the Amanita Studies Website, I see that a white \u0026#8220;collar\u0026#8221; atop the basal bulb of crenulata may represent the limbus internus. This appears to be consistent with the stipe bases seen in this observation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUniversal veil deposits on cap are consistent with crenulate, as are the short-striate cap margins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGills are narrowly attached to stipe, consistent with crenulata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpore morphology fits crenulata, with Q maybe on the small side.
