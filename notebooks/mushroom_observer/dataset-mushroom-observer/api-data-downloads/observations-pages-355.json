Bon, section Emeticinae, Melzer \u0026amp; Zvara (Ref.: 2). Spore are rather small and correspond to two species listed in Ref.:2: Russula emetica var. sylvestris = Russula silvestris (current name according to Index Fungorum) and Russula emetica var. grisescens. The last one is much bigger than this find and also has grayish stipe. Several other species have been also considered. Russula luteotacta was tentatively proposed (Ref. 1) since habit, habitat and particularly hut colors correspond well to this find (spot wise fading to pinkish and whitish with older specimens). However, gills are not broadly attached or +/- decurrent as they should be with R. luteotacta (Ref.:3). Also similar Russula mairei Sing. was considered. However, measured spores seems to be too broad (5.2-6.6 µm for Russula mairei (Ref.3)). It also has slightly beige spore print and grows on damp soil, which doesn\u0026#8217;t fit to this find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe determined this find to Russula silvestris. This species is found primarily near conifers (particularly Pinus) but also in hardwood and mixed forests including near Fagus and Picea trees (Ref. 3). Nevertheless, the confidence of the determination is not high. Chemical tests and more microscopy would be needed for a more reliable result\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing solitary and scattered; 10 + pilei on an area of about two m2; pilei diameter 2.9 – 6 cm, hut cuticle peels to about 50% of pilei radius and above; gills bruise slightly yellowish after a longer time (several hours); stipe 2 -4.5 cm long and 0.8 -1.2 cm in diameter; SP abundant, white, oac909.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Sony ILCE6000 / Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar E 16-70mm/ f4\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":30483,"consensus_name":"Russula silvestris","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":1115925},{"id":391141,"type":"observation","date":"2019-10-26","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.71595,"created_at":"2019-11-03T15:00:39.000Z","updated_at":"2020-02-13T00:21:24.000Z","number_of_views":17,"last_viewed":"2022-09-20T09:32:32.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFruiting at 2000ft elevation beneath Douglas fir, western red cedar and western hemlock.
