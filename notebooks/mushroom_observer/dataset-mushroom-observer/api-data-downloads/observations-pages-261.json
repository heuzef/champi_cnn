The full-length nrITS locus is 930 bps long in this organism/species (ITS1 = 468 bps, 5.8S = 161 bps, ITS2 = 301 bps).

There is no question we are dealing with the same North American species here, as the observed mismatching positions are scattered single-base ambiguities and gaps due to variable-length homopolymers or possibly editing errors.\u003cbr /\u003e\nCuriously, all seven accessions are from Canadian vouchers, but this species obviously has to be be widely distributed in the northeast, considering it was found in NJ.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e As to the ID, I don\u0026#8217;t how to call the present collection even though the species it represents may have been described by a mycologist of the past, e.g., A.H.

The gills are crowded and 0.3 cm wide; lamellulae are plentiful, of various lengths and are sub-truncate to rounded-attenuate.  The annulate stipe is whitish above the ring and stained grayish-brown below (probably due to handling), 8.5 cm long, 0.8 cm wide at apex, uniformly 0.6 cm thick below and all the way down to the somewhat squishy, subglobose bulb, which is 1.3 cm long and 1.1 cm wide and with a short, sub-abrupt edge.  The fuscous annulus is membranous, thin, collapsed and tightly appressed to the stipe, and is attached midway between the apex and the bulb (3 cm below cap-stipe juncture).  The volva is present as whitish to grayish, thin and appressed-felty patches near the cap margin and as a grayish-lavender appressed collar-like band on the bulb shoulder.  The flesh is white and solid, both in the cap and stipe, not staining.  The odor is nill.  The flesh was not tasted.
