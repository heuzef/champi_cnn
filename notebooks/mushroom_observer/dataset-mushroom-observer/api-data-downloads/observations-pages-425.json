Stem ranges from cream-white at the top down to orange and yellow towards the bottom. Large egg-shaped club at the bottom of stipe with fuzzy mold-like projections. Cap is flat or nearly flat, serrated cream-white gills that are thin and closely spaced. The texture of the gills are definitely waxy. Top of cap is literred with slightly oranged and browned warts, but when the warts are broken open, they are pearly white. Cap is mostly light orange yellow with almost no variation, except the center of cap is darker, but not quite a different color. Edge of cap has light striations,  with no noticable margin. The stipe, when snapped, snaps unevenly and breaks similar to a wet branch, with a nearly hollow center filled with spongy and soft tissue. The smell is reminiscent of portobellos and oyster mushrooms when broken open, but is faint and can only be smelled when the stipe is broken. The tissue of the cap is gradient, from pearly white to the orange found on the top, and the skin of the cap is tough to break and could be peeled. \u003cbr /\u003e\nEdit- the spore print was white,
