Of these, the only realistic match are two records – DQ486694 and FJ168569 – corresponding to the same voucher: ‘Coprinopsis atramentaria PMB922’ from Washington, USA (100% cover, 617/621= 99.4% similar; 3 shared ambiguities and a G/T mismatch in a mixed homopolymeric stretch). None of these mismatches happen to be significant, and it appears that MO379875 is conspecific with the WA voucher.  While accession ‘Coprinopsis atramentaria BP-12’ from India (MK386821) is 99.5% similar, the query cover is only 64%, as most of its ITS2 and the first 47 bps of ITS1 are missing.  The 4th accession, KT833863, is only 95.8% similar, so it clearly another species.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAs to the other 10 accessions in the phylogram labeled ‘C. atramentaria’, they may represent as many as 8 taxa.
