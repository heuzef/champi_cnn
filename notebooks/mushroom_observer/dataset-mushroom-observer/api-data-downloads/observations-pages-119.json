Stipe apex white; middle white; base, yellowish white, and breaks partially in half when bent, leaving a long jagged piece on one side. stipe hollow.  Partial veil membranaceous and superior.

Usually most  of the specimens I have found growing on wood have more than one colour in layers from the centre.  Also this fungi\u0026#8217;s habit in growth was circular.  It was important to note that the thickness was \u0026#8220;Paper Thin\u0026#8221; and the whole body was very easily folded or bent. No unusual aroma even when dried. The texture of the fungi although flexible was also quite tough when I attempted to break a section away. I have added a couple of scoped images but as usual unsure if they are of any assistance. I found only two of this particular growth in the whole area I worked.

All G.oregonense/G.tsugae(fresh stem butt) specimens were transplanted from Mora campground near Rialto beach in summer 2011(where we harvest lbs of Reishi).  This season we finally saw multiple fresh fruiting bodies from the fallen Western hemlock log here on 17th Ave trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe cut deep holes in the log and simply stuffed the large, fresh stems of multiple specimens into the inner pith and covered wounds with soil and moss.  Remarkably, the log was already prolifically fruiting G.applanatum in 2011 when we attempted the inoculation- two years later there are more varnish conks than artist conks.  Apparently this method is possible-from an anecdotal perspective.
