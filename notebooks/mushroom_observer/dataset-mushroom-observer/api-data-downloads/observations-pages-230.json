However, genus Hygrocybe and particularly H. conica (agg.) is difficult for determination. Taxonomy described by different authors differs widely. I keep with Boertmann (Ref.7). Species H. acutoconica differs from members of H. conica agg. by absence of fast and deep blackening of fruitbodies during handling and in time. Pilei photographed didn\u0026#8217;t blacken (or at least evidently much less than H. conica). H. acutoconica var. acutoconica has predominantly cylindrical, oblong and occasionally slightly constricted spores, which are. 5 \u0026#8211; 6.5 microns wide (from 2-sterigmata basidia). Measured spores were evidently different \u0026#8211; broadly elliptical, some elliptical and some subglobose. Their width was 7.4-7.9 microns (only 2-sterigmata basidia observed). Such spores correspond to Hygrocybe acutoconica var. konradii. According to Boertmann (2010) H. acutoconica var. acutoconica and H. acutoconica var. konradii are very similar and can be separated only by spore dimensions and shape. Pilei color og this find is unusual. It should \u0026#8216;normally\u0026#8217; be yellow to reddish-yellow, however, Boertmann (2001) exceptionally allows also \u0026#8220;\u0026#8230; even entirely reddish\u0026#8221;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo fruitbodies present; pilei diameter 35 and 32 mm (measured as is, not expanded), slightly viscid; stems 67 and 72 mm long, 6 and 7 mm in diameters, slightly viscid, with small diameter hollow central channel, fibrous; not bruising black when handling, only after long time becoming somewhat darker and duller; SP abundant, whitish-yellowish, oac 899.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Canon G11, 6.1-30mm/f2.8-4.5\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":51362,"consensus_name":"Hygrocybe subsect.
