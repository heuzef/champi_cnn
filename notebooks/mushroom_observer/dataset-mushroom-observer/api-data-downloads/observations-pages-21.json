On inspection, appeared to be a black variety of something that I have never seen.   Clustered, pileus about 3 inches, stipe about 1 inch.  Pileus was darker (similar to black chanterelle) than stipe, but lamella not decurrent.  Within 10 hours of collection, stipe also turned black, and the interior of stipe was black throughout when cut 12 hours later. Other specimens left for observation.
