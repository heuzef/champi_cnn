It represents a luminescent strain of P. stipticus, a normally lamellate, white-rot wood decomposer, probably cultured from material from eastern North America, although I do not know the origin of the culture. The abnormal, coralloid growth form results in artificial culture possibly from high CO2 conditions that cause stipe etiolation. If you look carefully you can see immature, unopened pilei on the tips of some branches. The time-lapse video taken in a studio in the UK was mocked up to look like it was shot in natural conditions in the Congo, including the addition of a forest in the background. It is a fabrication. Panellus stipticus has not been reported from the Congo region, and in nature grows on woody sticks. Do not fly off to the Congo and expect to discover a luminescent coral fungus.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you ever believe the BBC or David Attenborough again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll thanks go to Mike Wood for originally breaking the story.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":181,"consensus_id":16,"consensus_name":"Panellus stipticus","location_id":2777,"location_name":"London, England","primary_image_id":304021},{"id":123335,"type":"observation","date":"2011-05-18","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.69154,"created_at":"2013-01-25T02:38:35.000Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T20:11:19.000Z","number_of_views":29,"last_viewed":"2024-01-10T23:18:36.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound on Dead Decicuous wood near a creek.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1685,"consensus_id":22781,"consensus_name":"Cerioporus squamosus","location_id":2900,"location_name":"Hunlock Creek, Luzerne Co., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":304022},{"id":123336,"type":"observation","date":"2011-04-22","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.69624,"created_at":"2013-01-25T02:51:14.000Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T13:19:38.000Z","number_of_views":35,"last_viewed":"2024-04-04T15:35:40.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eChambered, brittle cap with thick stem, terrestrial, among Ash Trees and high bushes.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1685,"consensus_id":2399,"consensus_name":"Gyromitra korfii","location_id":13754,"location_name":"Frances Slocum State Park, Luzerne Co., Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":304025},{"id":123337,"type":"observation","date":"2003-12-13","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.37463,"created_at":"2013-01-25T03:07:45.000Z","updated_at":"2013-01-25T19:10:39.000Z","number_of_views":29,"last_viewed":"2024-01-05T03:29:31.000Z","owner_id":4649,"consensus_id":16,"consensus_name":"Panellus stipticus","location_id":6762,"location_name":"Braga, Portugal","primary_image_id":304030},{"id":123338,"type":"observation","date":"2013-01-20","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":false,"confidence":1.72088,"created_at":"2013-01-25T15:46:47.000Z","updated_at":"2016-07-02T16:31:26.000Z","number_of_views":38,"last_viewed":"2024-01-16T23:31:20.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003edisplay ID: SOMA2013-0242\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":481,"consensus_id":751,"consensus_name":"Bovista","location_id":1747,"location_name":"SOMA Camp, Occidental, Sonoma Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":304035},{"id":123339,"type":"observation","date":"2013-01-25","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.51165,"created_at":"2013-01-25T16:01:58.000Z","updated_at":"2013-12-25T05:07:58.000Z","number_of_views":253,"last_viewed":"2024-04-10T00:15:00.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing directly under Arctostaphylos viscida in the USFS parking lot.
