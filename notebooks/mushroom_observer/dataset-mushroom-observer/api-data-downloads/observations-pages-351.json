Zeller described Calvatia subcretacea as a new species based on Calvatia-type eucapillitium, lack of subgleba, and other Calvatia-like characteristics. Ponce de Leon (1976) transferred Calvatia subcretaceae to Gastropila subcretaceae following the publication of Gastropila as a new genus by Homrich \u0026amp; Wright (1973). Gastropila was circumscribed by having smooth spores, a three-layered peridium, and smooth, sparsely branched, not easily broken, much entangled eucapillitium (Homrich and Wright 1973) . The use of SEM imaging on California material debunks the transfer of this species to Gastropila, showing echinate spores and Calvatia-type eucapillitium. Kreisel (1989) erected the genus Handkea based on the slit-like nature of eucapillitium pits, and transferred Calvatia subcretacea into Handkea. Calvatia subcretacea has abundant slit-like pits on the capillitium threads when seen under light microscopy. With the use of SEM imaging, these slit-like pits clearly resemble cracks and breaks in the fragile capillitium walls. They do not seem to be genetically derived morphological characters. Additionally, phylogenetic results show that Handkea is a polyphyletic assemblage and that it’s members fall at different locations within the Lycoperdon clade (Bates 2004, Gube 2009, Larsson and Jeppson 2008). Jeppson and Larsson (2010) recorded Lycoperdon subcretaceum in Norway for the first time, with results showing that two different sequences of Lycoperdon subcretaceum and Handkea subcretacea from different regions of the world were identical to each other. They cluster together with 99% bootstrap support within the Lycoperdon clade, and quite distant from the Calvatia clade. Jeppson and Larsson (2010) reports fragile Lycoperdon-type eucapillitium in the material collected from Norway, and finely warted spores; whereas the material from California has Calvatia-type eucapillitium, and the exoperidium ornamentation seems much more exaggerated than that of the European collections. ITS sequence data comparing a collection from California and a sequence from Jeppson and Larsson (JN572908) study reiterates these findings. The molecular data shows Lycoperdon subcretaceum basal to the Lycoperdon clade, and shows these two sequences to be the same species with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP support, Because molecular data place this species in the Lycoperdon clade, it will be treated here as Lycoperdon subcretaceum.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":30533,"consensus_name":"Lycoperdon subcretaceum","location_id":720,"location_name":"Yuba Pass, Tahoe National Forest, Sierra Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1102726},{"id":386855,"type":"observation","date":"2019-08-10","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.837247,"created_at":"2019-10-10T19:47:30.000Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T04:36:07.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2023-05-23T21:20:19.000Z","owner_id":7313,"consensus_id":109094,"consensus_name":"Tricholosporum subporphyrophyllum","location_id":12880,"location_name":"Tepoztlán, Morelos, Mexico","primary_image_id":1102728},{"id":386856,"type":"observation","date":"2008-06-06","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"altitude":1774,"gps_hidden":true,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.44944,"created_at":"2019-10-10T19:56:54.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T01:54:00.000Z","number_of_views":127,"last_viewed":"2024-04-11T04:21:40.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFull taxonomic description:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13537\"\u003ehttps://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name_description/13537\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHabitat: Sometimes the fruitbodies of Calvatia fumosa will remain almost completely hypogeous throughout maturity in thick conifer duff, or are partially buried, subhypogeous.

When the spines slough off, they leave scar markings on the endoperidium just as exhibited on Lycoperdon perlatum. The spines on both species can be persistent if the fruitbody dries up too quickly. In this case the spines may not leave a scar appearance and may lead to misidentification. However the exoperidium of Lycoperdon perlatum remains in the cream to brown color tones through maturation, whereas Lycoperdon nigrescens becomes dark brown to almost black. Lycoperdon nigrescens Pers. should not be confused with Lycoperdon nigrescens (Pers.) Vittad., Monogr. Lycoperd. 2: 176 (1843) [nom. illegit.], which is currently named Bovista nigrescens Pers., Neues Mag. Bot. 1: 86 (1794). Bovista nigrescens Pers. is a completely different puffball, which could be confused with Bovista pila. Bovista nigrescens Pers. has a glabrous dark metallic endoperidium when mature, lacking a sterile base, and spores become dark purple brown. Bovista nigrescens is a European species, and has not been reported from California, whereas Lycoperdon nigrescens is a puffball with a large sterile base and is found along the coastal forests of Northern California. The results in ITS analysis shows strong support of a Lycoperdon nigrescens clade nested within Lycoperdon with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":1041,"consensus_name":"Lycoperdon nigrescens","location_id":8166,"location_name":"Humboldt State University, Arcata, Humboldt Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1103920},{"id":387252,"type":"observation","date":"2019-05-23","latitude":"42.9451","longitude":"-89.5838","altitude":241,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.53874,"created_at":"2019-10-13T02:19:02.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T09:47:46.000Z","number_of_views":16,"last_viewed":"2022-08-26T02:29:16.000Z","owner_id":12025,"consensus_id":22974,"consensus_name":"Ganoderma megaloma","location_id":16583,"location_name":"Olson Oak Woods State Natural Area, Dane Co., Wisconsin, USA","primary_image_id":1103923},{"id":387253,"type":"observation","date":"2009-11-15","latitude":"38.5779","longitude":"-123.33","altitude":43,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.45428,"created_at":"2019-10-13T02:20:42.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-13T02:20:45.000Z","number_of_views":95,"last_viewed":"2024-04-11T04:17:02.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eLycoperdon umbrinum\tPers., Syn. meth. fung.(Göttingen) 1: 147. 1801.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(fig. 34, 74)\u003cbr /\u003e\nReported synonyms \t\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t= Lycoperdon umbrinum ß hirtum Pers..1801.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t= Lycoperdon umbrinum var. hirsutum Alb. \u0026amp; Schwein., Consp. fung.

Growing as a solitary fruitbody to gregariously on soil under conifer duff, or among damp moss and other soil humus. Among the Geographic Subdivisions of California, this species is found in the Northwestern California, in the Cascade Range, in the Sierra Nevada, in Central Western California, and in Southwestern California. \u003cbr /\u003e\nDistribution: Known from many parts of the United States, and previously reported from Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Washington DC, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Also known from Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Mexico, Russia, Uruguay, and the USSR.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\tComments: There are four puffballs in California with similar features, requiring a light microscope to compare spore ornamentation and careful observation of the peridium characters for proper identification: Lycoperdon molle, Lycoperdon nigrescens, Lycoperdon perlatum, and Lycoperdon umbrinum. Lycoperdon molle can be distinguished by the granular and spinose exoperidium that does not leave scars on the endoperidium, and verrucose spores. Lycoperdon nigrescens is a puffball with a large sterile base, becomes dark brown to almost black, has prominent scars on the endoperidium where the spinose exoperidium has sloughed off, and verruculose spores. Lycoperdon perlatum is set apart from the others due to the exaggerated pseudostipe, spinose exoperidium that leaves prominent scars on the endoperidium, white to cream colors of the peridium layers throughout the life of the fruitbody, and echinulate spores. Lycoperdon umbrinum has a prominent pseudostipe, and a dark pigmented exoperidium that may seem glabrous to furfuraceous depending on the development of the granular and spinose ornamentation, in addition to verruculose spores. The very small spines of Lycoperdon umbrinum will fall off and leave minute scars on the endoperidium, which are much smaller than what is found on Lycoperdon nigrescens or Lycoperdon perlatum. Lycoperdon umbrinum has verrucose spores similar to Lycoperdon molle, however L. molle can grow much larger and has a much more prominent ornamentation on the exoperidium. The ITS sequence data from this study shows Lycoperdon umbrinum nested with Lycoperdon vernimontanum within the Lycoperdon clade with 100% bootstrap and 100% PP support. One of the sequences of Lycoperdon umbrinum more closely related to Lycoperdon vernimontanum than it does to another sequence of its same species. This suggests that additional genes should be sequenced to further clarify the taxonomic position of Lycoperdon umbrinum amongst the other taxa in the Lycoperdaceae in order to better understand the relationships of these fungi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaterial Examined: CALIFORNIA, Calaveras Co.: Camp Connell, Highway 4, 1 mile east, 1,524 meters (5,000 feet) elev., gregarious in litter under conifers, 23 October 1983, H.D.
