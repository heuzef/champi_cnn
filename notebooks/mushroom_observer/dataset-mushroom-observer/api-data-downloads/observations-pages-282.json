Gyalolechia fulgens is more common but still a rare species. First I thought I found Gyalolechia fulgens. However, later I realized that bare rock is not an appropriate substratum for it since it (mostly?) grows on soil, mosses and sand dunes (it is terricolous species). There were several specimens at the place of this observation and all of them grew on bare, hard calcareous rocks (were exception less saxicolous). This better fits to Gyalolechia fulgida (according to most sources). Gyalolechia fulgida also has convex squamulose thallus all the way to its center, while the thallus of Gyalolechia fulgens is usually smoother or areolate in the central region (Ref.7). Gyalolechia fulgens also prefers less arid habitats than Gyalolechia fulgida (Ref.4.). The habitat of this find is very dry, which also supports my determination. Thallus and apothecia K+ crimson fits to both species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, information about Gyalolechia fulgida I was able to find is very scarce (not mentioned at all in all of my books) and sometimes contradictory. For example: different description of thallus; several authors state also soils as substrate of Gyalolechia fulgida (some even exclusively) and others mention also calcareous rock as a possible substrate for Gyalolechia fulgens.
