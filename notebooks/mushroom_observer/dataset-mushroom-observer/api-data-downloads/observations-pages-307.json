I had planned to monitor the growth of flushes here and take multiple time lapse images(as with last season) for a few weeks to show development and stages of fruiting, but alas, local children and dogs got to the patch before I could add any updates.

The stems are white and fibrous and bruise dark blue. The caps bruise blue-green and there are purple/brown spores left on the stems and caps of some mushrooms.
