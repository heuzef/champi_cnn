Along with Psathyrella I wanted to try a few Crepidotus also.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of hyphae from the pileus surface at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  Here  there is clearly clamp connections, I\u0026#8217;ve been told this is fairly obvious for most Crepidotus, that the clamps in the surface hyphae are large.  Also these hyphae are pigmented and nicely textured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.

There are no pleurocystidia observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of some spores taken from the gill at 1000x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  I can\u0026#8217;t take spores from the stipe apex, since there is no stipe, I need to think of a better way to look at mature spores in these.

Also there are the warted spores, which are 7.5 \u0026#215; 5.4 um, on 7 spores measured.  The shape of these with the pointed tear-drop closely matches the drawing for this species.  In the monograph, the features match well either G. liquiritiae or G. croceoluteus (and there is some mention of G. oregonesis), and says that G. liquiritiae is the \u0026#8220;common\u0026#8221; species, with samples seen from many places in NA, including CA.  But that the feature that separates the species is the \u0026#8220;interwoven pileus trama\u0026#8221;.  This can be seen in the third photo.  This is a \u0026#8220;crown section\u0026#8221;, taken from a thin slice on center top of the pileus, but the interwoven trama was confirmed from radial and marginate sections also.

Because they were in grass, I thought that perhaps they were not G. autumnalis, but were in the same group (sensu. Smith and Singer).  They have the macroscopic look of G. autumnalis, with the fiberous stipes that darken from the base, a fibrous zone form the veil, the \u0026#8220;bell-shaped\u0026#8221; cap, which are not umbonate, flat on top, with caps that curl inwards, and have margins that point back towards the stipe when young, and hygrophanous caps that are slightly striate at the margin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut G. autunmalis should be found on wood, and these are in grass.  But when I went through the micro-details, they are just G. autumnalis (even though I tried to make them something else).  The grassy area was at the edge of a conifer forest, and near by a fallen log, I would have to assume the ground contained quite a bit of woody debris.  G. autumnalis is usually found on well rotten wood, not freshly fallen stuff, and the ground under the grass must have a lot of well rotten stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the cheilocystidia, at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The cystidia are the classic autumnalis shape, sub-pointed, and some club-shaped, but not capitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of a radial section of the cap, displaying the cap surface.  There is a gelatin layer on the surface, with the hyphae loosely embedded.  The hyphae are hyline, and not thickened.  These features really make it G. autumnalis sensu. Smith and Singer.  If there was no gelatin layer, it would be in the G. marginata group, and if the hyphae were colored it would be G. unicolor (which for some reason is the only species they described which can or can not display a gelatin layer).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last micro shot displays the spores trapped in the fibrous veil tissue.  The spores are clearly roughened, as others in the autumnalis group, compared to other Galerinas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, after all that, note on DNA studies.  There were studies done a few years ago, that state G. autumnalis, G. marginata, G. unicolor, and others, are all the same species.  In the Smith and Singer monograph of NA Galerina, these species are really separated by the qualities of the pileus surface.  The spore sizes, roughness, veil features, and cystidia for these species named in the DNA studies are comparable.  This suggests that the gelatin layer, and hyphae thickness and color of the pileipellis are just species variations.  That study suggests that all these species be named G. marginata, since that is the oldest name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m going with G. autumnalis for now, until I can find more comparible samples which only differ in qualities of the cap surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were dried and placed in the SFSU herbarium for further study in the future.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":266,"consensus_name":"Galerina autumnalis","location_id":1,"location_name":"Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":9623},{"id":5677,"type":"observation","date":"2007-12-01","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.834764,"created_at":"2007-12-27T21:22:17.000Z","updated_at":"2018-11-08T23:23:05.000Z","number_of_views":208,"last_viewed":"2024-04-09T18:06:23.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eThese were found at the edge of a grassy area, in among some moss, but also small woody debris.

back over some Cystoderma collections, to see what can be seen\u0026#8230;  putting these under the scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  Here the epithelium of the surface can be seen, with the pigmented globose cells.  There don\u0026#8217;t appear to be any arthospores in the pileus context, but I not sure what I should be looking for there, but in C. fallax you are not supposed to see hardly any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  What is important here is what you don\u0026#8217;t see, there are no cystidia.  Also the spores can be seen to be amyloid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of spores from the veil tissue at 1000x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The spores are ellipsoid to subglobose and amyloid.  There are lots of spores to get the size well, so the ave. size was found to be : length \u0026#8211; 4.73 +/- 0.30 (err 0.07) um, width \u0026#8211; 3.59 +/- 0.24 (err: 0.06) um \u0026#8211; q : 1.32 +/- 0.08, on 28 spores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, this pretty much agrees with the pub. description for C. fallax.  Except for the width of the spores.  The length of the spores is a little long 4.73 +/- 0.30 compared to 4.44 +/- 0.24, but those are consistant.  The width was found here to be 3.59 +/- 0.24, compared to 3.05 +/- 0.12 that was pub., which aren\u0026#8217;t really consistent.  This makes me wonder a bit if I choose a little large in the measurements of size, and that small error shows up in determinations of very short distances like this\u0026#8230;  Anyway, it is close enough given everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, this one is a good obs. of C. fallax for California.  The main feature it seems for C. fallax is the veil, where it is a flaring, persistent, membranous veil.  There are a number of obs. that are labeled as C. fallax here, that I don\u0026#8217;t think they are.  There is also a note in the study that C. fallax is rusty brown, and never yellow-ocher.  I think a number of C. fallax obs. here, esp. from Mendocino area, are not, but some other Cystoderma species.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":277,"consensus_name":"Cystoderma
