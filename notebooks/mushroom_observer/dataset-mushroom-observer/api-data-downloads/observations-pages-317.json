But several other taxa can be very similar. For example: Jackrogersella minutella (former Hypoxylon cohaerens var. microsporum) and Jackrogersella multiformis (former Annulohypoxylon multiforme) and a few others can have similar stromatal features. Microscopy is needed for a reliable determination. Tentative field identification often relies on host. Jackrogersella minutella is restricted to Quercus and Castanea, Jackrogersella multiformis grows mostly on Betula, Alnus and Corylus and Jackrogersella cohaerens is restricted to Fagus sylvatica.  However, host specificity is rarely absolute. Since no microscopy was done for this observation, the determination remains unreliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRef.: \u003cbr /\u003e\n(1) \u003ca href=\"https://www.123pilze.de/DreamHC/Download/ZusammenKohlebeere.htm\"\u003ehttps://www.123pilze.de/...\u003c/a\u003e (accessed Dec. 22. 2018)\u003cbr /\u003e\n(2) \u003ca href=\"http://pyrenomycetes.free.fr/hypoxylon/html/Hypoxylon_cohaerens.htm\"\u003ehttp://pyrenomycetes.free.fr/...\u003c/a\u003e (accessed Dec. 22.2018)\u003cbr /\u003e\n(3) M.W.Beug, A.E.
