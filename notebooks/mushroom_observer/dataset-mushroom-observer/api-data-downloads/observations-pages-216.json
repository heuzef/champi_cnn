The caps\u0026#8217; original color is rosy-red (i.e., more bicolor-like) at the time of collection in the woods, but the pictures taken ~2.5 hrs post collection show a different hue (notice the \u0026#8220;dimples\u0026#8221; are still purple-red to rose-red); hours later, the color was observed as tannish-pink over the disc and still rose-red toward the periphery.  The pore surface is dingy lemon yellow, bluing when injured; the bluing gradually dissipates to grayish brown, finally resolving medium brown.  The pores are clogged in the young fb, as visualize with a lens, and are variably-sized and round in the older fb, 3-4 pores per mm. The tube layer is 3-4 mm  thick at the widest section, bluing when cut.  The stipes are 8-9 cm long, 1.5-1.7 cm wide at the apex and 1.8-2.3 cm wide at the base, curved and twisted, and with a very uneven and convoluted surface topology.  The stipe surface color is ranging from medium scarlet red in the bottom half, transitioning to orangish-red and mixed with yellow-brown hues the upper half, with a very narrow yellow band at the juncture with the pore surface.  The younger fb is unevenly reticulate over the upper 1-1.5 cm on one side of the stipe and is smooth on the other side; the older fb is delicately reticulate just at the apex. \u003cbr /\u003e\n The context is very firm, especially in the stipe, whitish to very pale yellow in the cap, light to medium lemon yellow in the stipe, gradually bluing in the cap above the tubes (in the smaller fb), with just a trace of bluing in the older one (see pix). \u003cbr /\u003e\n Taste is mild and not distinct.

The nrLSU trace is missing about 1/3 of the 5’ end because there is a non-specific region between primers LR22 and LR3.\u0026#8221;  Nevertheless, both sequences are still useful, as the nrITS contiguous fragment is 541 nucleotides long and the nrLSU contiguous fragment is 920 nucleotides long.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e A GenBank BLAST search of the nrITS fragment did not return an matching or meaningful hits.
