under live oak, madrone, california bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one had been bothering me for years.  I only found this one when it was old, and I couldn\u0026#8217;t tell if it was Psathyrella or Coprinellus/Coprinopsis.  Finally found a young one, and it doesn\u0026#8217;t look like Psathyrella now.  So, getting a little closer\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding microscopic details\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in KOH.  Here the surface is cellular, of globose cells in a single layer.  There are numerous pileocytidia, which are fusiod to fusiod-ventricose with blunt to acute apecies, regularly species on the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in KOH.  Here are cheilocystidia also fusoid-ventricose, thin walled, hyaline, numerous.  No pleurocystidia were obs.  4-spored basidia were obs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of spores on the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are dark grey-brown ellipsoid, smooth with a clear germ pore, about 10-11 um long.  Also caulocystidia similar to other cystidia were obs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis all matches up pretty well with the description in Champions du Suisse tome 4 of Coprinus impatiens, and the photo of the guys in-situ is a good match also.  I then found it matches pretty well with the Coprinus key from the PWN key counsil, so I\u0026#8217;m not sure what my problem is, I should have id\u0026#8217;ed this years ago.  Then I see that it also has a mention in Arora\u0026#8230; if I had just followed the keys, and believed what they were saying to me.  I just had to wait years until I had a dried sample in hand, and microscopic details to just get the same result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChecking in Index fungorum, it seems that this species has been moved into Coprinellus from Coprinus.  So, anyway, there a fairly complete id, perhaps not that uncommon a species, and looks fairly easy to id by eye, in the

The only hypogeous species I have been able to document is Mycolevis siccigleba, hence this identification. Sporocarps are up to 2 inches in diameter, often subglobose to somewhat flattened; with a relatively thick peridium and abundant pubescent hairs on the peridium, often with soil adherring strongly; with splotchy greenish-yellow highlights; columella not seen in my collection; loculate, locules tiny and appear widely scattered through the gleba; odor similar to very mild Hymenogaster or rotting fruit, somewhat foul to my nose; gleba with tints of light blue-green color or chrysoprase (a semi-precious gemstone also known as nickel bloom); typically found in late January or early February at Paul\u0026#8217;s; parasitized by some form of insect as shown in the accompanying photos. I have collected this many times in the past 20 years at Paul\u0026#8217;s but never took a close look at the peridium, and never took photos to document it. Am currently drying several specimens.

Here the lecythiform cheilocystidia can be seen, so this is really a Conocybe.  Also there are no pleurocystidia, and there are 4-spored basidia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of some cap tissue at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The cap is hymeniform, so it is still a Conocybe, also there is no gelatin or pileocystidia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of the stipe surface from the apex at 400x in KOH.

And some are the womping big suckers, like large inflated balloons with a roughened surface.  The edge cystidia are all slightly pigmented and smoky.  Also obs. were plenty of pleurocystidia, which were mostly lageniform and thin walled, and hyaline.  There were some, widely spaced, pleurocystidia that were largely inflated and smoky pigmented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is also of the gill edge at 400x in KOH, showing more of the different types of cystidia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth micro-shot is of spores from the gill at 1000x in KOH.

I was always a little confused as how easy it would be to tell a Naucoria from a Galerina, as small mycenoid fungi with ornamented brown spores.  But the Naucoria spores are more consistently warted with small regular warts, and Galerina spores are more randomly roughened, so you can tell them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the multi element caulocystidia, It didn\u0026#8217;t look like any Naucoria from Europe are like this.  I couldn\u0026#8217;t find much in the way of Naucoria info from North America.  It makes me feel bad for these pore ignored little guys\u0026#8230; no one to care for them\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn trying to look up Naucoria obs. from California, it kinda makes me not want to use the name Naucoria.  Lots of stuff was Naucoria in the past, Tubaria, Galerina, Simocybe, Phaeocollybia, and others.  Any small brown spored genus seems to have been Naucoria at some point in the past almost.  But the only stuff left in the genus now are these small guys, with warted spores under alder or beech.  Perhaps it would be better to call them Alnicola, as many have done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, here are some unknown, probably undescribed Naucoria from California.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":1391,"consensus_name":"Alnicola","location_id":8,"location_name":"Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":80476},{"id":34533,"type":"observation","date":"2010-03-02","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.39181,"created_at":"2010-03-05T23:32:00.000Z","updated_at":"2013-07-22T20:16:56.000Z","number_of_views":115,"last_viewed":"2023-11-03T02:02:41.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003e[admin \u0026#8211;
