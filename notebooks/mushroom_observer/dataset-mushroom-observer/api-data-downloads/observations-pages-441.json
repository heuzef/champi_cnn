It is growing on a black locust (\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Robinia+pseudoacacia\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eRobinia pseudoacacia\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e), which appears to be alive because it has green leaves and seed pods in its canopy. However, the black locust does have a big dead branch (~7cm diameter). This fungus is growing on the trunk at the base of the dead branch, so it is uncertain whether it is growing on live or dead wood. Directly beneath the fungus, there appears to be a rusty/brick-red/brownish powder that has fallen onto the tree and on the surface of some ivy leaves that are growing there. I have not examined this powder with a microscope, but I believe it to be an aggregation of spores that have fallen from the polypore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdentification: With a few exceptions, the features of this specimen closely match the description of the Cracked-cap Polypore found on pgs. 476-477 of \u003cem\u003eNational Audubon Society Field Guide for North American Mushrooms\u003c/em\u003e (1981). The descriptions of general morphological features, spore color and habitat are consistent with my observations of this specimen. For example, the “Habitat” section on pg. 476 reads: “On living or dead black locust; reported on other trees in the same family.”, and the specimen is growing on a living black locust tree that has a large dead branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther Notes: I initially identified this specimen as \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Phellinus+rimosus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhellinus rimosus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Berk.) Pil., using the Audubon field guide mentioned above. However, I am aware of at least two other names that have been used for this species. The first of these alternate names, \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Fomes+rimosus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eFomes rimosus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, appeared in the “Comments” section of the aforementioned description of the Cracked-cap Polypore (i.e. from the Audubon guide). The second of these alternate names that I encountered is \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Fulvifomes+rimosus\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eFulvifomes rimosus\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (Berk.)
