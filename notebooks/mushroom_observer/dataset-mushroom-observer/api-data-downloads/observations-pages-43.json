These mushrooms have been found all over in the mainly conferous woods on our property in the mountains. There are also maple, birch and other mixed trees around. The mushrooms grow in bunches on the bases of old tree trunks \u0026amp; roots, but also here and there on the woodland floor. The scent is like the finest oyster mushrooms.

growing under the low canopy of a thorny tree with black berries on it. There were several different stages of this mushroom, I have on my lap a small one and a large one. On the mature mushroom, the top is almost flat, there is a slight peak, the edges are curled under, kinda wavy. The top is white, with very slight accents of tan. The top also has three large deep cracks that radiate from the center. The The gills are white, broad, extend all the way from the definable outer edge of the cap, to the stem, where they are attached. There is no notch, but they do not run down the stem. There is no ring arond the stem, nor any trace of one. The stem is short, very fat, and the base is bulbous, with no trace of the volva. There is no trace of any veil arond the gills either.There are wide cracks rnning down the sten as well. The flesh does not bruise any different color when it is cut, it is all white. The texture is spongy, almost like a white store mushroom, only there is a lot more of it. the juvenile, has no veil, no rong, no volva, and looks just like the big one, complete with the cracks on the top of the cap and down the stem. looks just like the big one, except the edges arent so deeply wavy.

It provides within its chamber a place for the bark beetle to winter over, and become coated with spores, which it includes when injecting its eggs into the bark of damaged or stressed pine trees. The beetle larvae then proceed to create galleries under the bark of the tree. Should the beetle larvae girdle the tree underneath the bark, the tree can and often does die, ensuring the continued production of more Cryptoporus volvatus. Identification of this fungus is therefore a key for removing infected trees which likely harbor bark beetle larvae. It is possible that there exists a parasitic fungus that is specific to bark beetles.
