It is extremely variable morphologically, but also microscopically traits are variable and barely sufficient to separate several taxa of this group (P. cinereus, P. igniarius s.str., P. alni). Several authors do not recognize fully these taxa. Antioxidative and anti-cancer effects of Phellinus igniarius extracts have been observed..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no microscopy for this find; hence the determination is uncertain. However, young sporocarps of Phellinus igniarius often have roundish shape with rounded inflated pileus margin like this find. Dark (reddish) brown, woody and concentrically layered trama, pores and pileus surface and color correspond reasonably well to Phellinus igniarius, or, at least, this is the best fit I was able to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding substratum Salix is the most common for this species, but it has been found also on many other broadleaved trees.
