Strobilomyces specimen growing from the trunk of a large mature Shortleaf Pine.

I thought the first might be an odd accident, but this one was attached via a short side-ways stem directly to the tree bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn each case, the trees were large mature healthy trees. This one was at least 20 inch diameter at the base. This specimen was growing about 3 inches above the ground, similar to the previous observation. This specimen was fresh, the top tufts soft, the gills soft. The previous one was completely desiccated. I discussed this with Dr. D. Lewis who has collected for years in the Big Thicket. He says it is not unusual for Boletes, including S. confusus. He thinks it is the mycelium escaping wet and flooded conditions. This describes the extreme wet this spring and early summer in all East Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon slicing, the cross-section was pale but quickly turned a rosy tan, then eventually black. I noticed no smell, but I have hay-fever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicroscopy:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI created a small scalp of the cap, then cut a thin section from the scalp. I\u0026#8217;ve attached images of the cap surface material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cells at the outer surface were difficult to observe as they were very dark and filled with dark material. Cells lightened as they progressed inward. The more interior ones were easier to view and show dark walls and dark material forming inside. The cells more interior in the white layer were very light, no dark walls and appeared to be a jumble of short segments(no image).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpores were found and showed Spore ornamentation of ridges and lines which did not form a complete reticulum. Shown in last photo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis indicates that it best fits Strobilomyces confusus\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":5452,"consensus_id":3752,"consensus_name":"Strobilomyces
