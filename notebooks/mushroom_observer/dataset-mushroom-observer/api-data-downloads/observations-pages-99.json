Found growing in rings in grass that was formerly horse pasture. Caps are 2 to 5 cm wide, moist from the rain, rubbery, tough, smell sweet and almost anise, but not anise. Stems are mostly straight, but sometimes narrow down, and nearly all are flattened, even young ones. Gills are much more numerous than Marasmius oreades it seems but the spore print is whitish.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe scent and the number of gills are throwing me off target. To compound my confusion, I also have Clitocybe fragrans growing under western red cedar about 30 meters away. They are pretty obvious in strong anise odor, not in rings and not in the open grass.
