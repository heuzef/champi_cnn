Several other names can be found in literature as synonyms: C. turmalis, C. claricolor, C. sericelus, etc. where C. turmalis seems to be most often used. However Breitenbach Ref.(8) states violet color of mycelium for C. turmalis, which was not the case of this observation. Also, data from literature on spore dimensions for C. turmalis often state bigger spores than observed. Therefore I am staying with C. sebaceus. The observation fits very well to Daehncke Ref.(2) and Ref.

overall appearance of this fertile specimen is similar to that of my previous observations of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyrrhospora+quenea\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePyrrhospora quenea\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. However, the thallus is not as granulose as usual, being more farinose; The chemistry also differs, not reacting C+ orange and remaining C-. To try to learn more about this specimen I tried the microscopy. This revealed at the initial stage, while preparing the slide, a red reaction caused by some soluble substance in NH4OH. The spores are very small (so no precise values for their dimensions are possible), broadly elipsoid to subglobose allocated in asci (at least seeming) of Lecanora type. This clearly points to \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Pyrrhospora\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePyrrhospora\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.
