But the plant is not completely without chlorophyll. Despite the presence of photosynthetic pigments, CO2 fixation seems to be insufficient to compensate for respiration in adult plants (Ref.:(2)). Therefore fungal symbionts are needed to survive. Interestingly, seedlings develop very slowly, spending up to ten years underground before flowering. Growing in a group of a few plants. This plant is not common in Slovenia, however, also not a very rare one. It has very short time of flowering, which makes it difficult to find flowers \u0026#8216;in a good shape\u0026#8217; for photography.
