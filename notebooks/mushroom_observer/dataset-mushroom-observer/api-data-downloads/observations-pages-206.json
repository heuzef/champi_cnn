In two of the granite blocks I found a large number of specimens with the same characteristics of that observation. One of the specimens, the presented at the last picture taken on site, shows the most developed apothecia that are similar to some species of Rinodina I have ever encountered, particularly \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Ramaria+atrocinerea\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eR. atrocinerea\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Ramaria+beccariana\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eR. beccariana\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhile I do not have the means to collect rock samples in this case they will not serve much, since the rock is compact and has no cracks.

The result was what presented in the attached photographs.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThese are instructive and show that my previous ideas about this lichen were correct. The hymenium and spores are clearly a species of the genus Rinodina and the spores are Pachysporaria-type. Taking into account the analysis of the species with these spores made in the comments of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/204088\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobservation 204088\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and the chemistry (C+ \u0026amp; KC+ orange/red, K+ yellow, spot tests carried out on the observation cited above), I think we are in the presence of specimens of species \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Ramaria+atrocinerea\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eR. atrocinerea\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which I have already found this year elsewhere (see \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/236227\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobservation 236227\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP.S.: Just now I consulted the webpage of AFL and saw the photos of \u0026#8220;Rinodina aspersa subsp. atrocinerea\u0026#8221; and the 2nd photo (magnification of the 1st?) show very similar young apothecia emerging from the areolas; Link: \u003ca href=\"http://www.afl-lichenologie.fr/Photos_AFL/Photos_AFL_R/Rinodina_aspersa_atrocinerea.htm\"\u003ehttp://www.afl-lichenologie.fr/...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":2250,"consensus_id":13532,"consensus_name":"Rinodina atrocinerea","location_id":939,"location_name":"Sintra, Portugal","primary_image_id":613643},{"id":237388,"type":"observation","date":"2016-04-25","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.72823,"created_at":"2016-04-26T19:00:14.000Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T19:00:20.000Z","number_of_views":162,"last_viewed":"2024-03-28T21:31:19.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eThis observation is very much related with \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/110992\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobservation 110992\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.
