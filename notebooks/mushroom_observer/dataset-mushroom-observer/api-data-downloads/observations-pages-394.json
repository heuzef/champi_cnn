The raw reads showed two points of heterogeneity \u0026#8212; one early in ITS1 and the other one in late ITS2.  In both cases it\u0026#8217;s a 1-base frame shift.  In the end, two main haplotypes were recovered after the heterogeneity had been carefully resolved in both reads to achieve a consensus region of 466 bps.  The major haplotype of 555 bps is 2 characters longer than the other one.  Additionally, 3 isolated ambiguities were resolved (all in ITS1), thanks to the frame shift.  Because the forward read has tall noise obscuring early ITS1 and the haplotypes in the reverse read were not resolved much past the point of heterogeneity in ITS1 due to the presence of triple peaks (3 haplotypes in total), the first ~40 characters of ITS1 are not reported here.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe major/longer haplotype is 98.56~99.82% similar to 12 GenBank accession, all of which but one are labeled as \u003ccite\u003eA. canescens/A. radiata/A. media\u003c/cite\u003e.

The ITS1F-LR22 amplicon was sequenced with the same primers to produce a contiguous nrDNA sequence of 1130 bps consisting of the last 34 of nrSSU followed by a full-length ITS sequence of 766 bps and then by the first 330 bps of nrLSU.  The two reads overlap in the ITS2 region for a total of 113 characters, effectively making this sequence a \u0026#8220;joined contig\u0026#8221; rather than a consensus sequence; the rather short overlap has to do with the read quality affecting this and many other sequences for this batch of samples.\u003cbr /\u003e\nA BLASTn-100 of the full-length ITS sequence is shown in \u003cb\u003eFig. 1\u003c/b\u003e.

He collected samples and provided them to me.  These examples are a species that I have not seen in my area before (although it could be familiar to a more experienced collector).  The individual fruiting bodies seemed to grow from the top of large masses of white tissue.  The stipes were impressively bulbous at the bottom, rising about 9.0 cm and supporting tan-colored, leather-like, white-gilled caps.  All of the material seemed well matured.  The cap cuticles were smooth with the appearance and texture of soft tan leather over a pure white flesh.  The margins of the caps were incurved.  The largest cap measured 11.0 cm in diameter. Stipes were solid and white inside, and no color change from bruising, application of KOH, NH4OH, or FeSo4 was noted.  It appeared that the gills on my examples were not free but had mostly been torn away from the stipes by aging.
