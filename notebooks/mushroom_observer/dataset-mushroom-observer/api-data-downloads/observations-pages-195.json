Both mushrooms are very similar. Measured spore dimensions fit to both. However, the pilei found seem smaller then of Melanoleuca exscissa, lack relatively short stipe compared to pilei diameter, have less crowded gills (L = 54) than Melanoleuca exscissa (L = 60 \u0026#8211; 95, Ref.: 2) and spores doesn\u0026#8217;t have verrucose spore surface. Therefore Dermoloma seems a better fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNames Dermoloma hygrophorus and Dermoloma josserandii are treated as synonyms by some authors (Ref.:4), while Index Fungorum and MycoBank threat both names as separate species. Dermoloma josserandii is known in two varieties Dermoloma josserandii var. josserandii with whitish-beige cap and Dermoloma josserandii var. phaeopodium with dark brown cap (Refs.: 2 and 4 and MycoBank). However, Index Fungorum treats Dermoloma josserandii var. josserandii only as a synonym of Dermoloma josserandii. Anyway, the find with its fruitbody dimensions, spore size, minutely granular cap, somewhat twisted, tapering downward and silky lined stem fits to our knowledge best to Dermoloma josserandii var. josserandii as described Ref.2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree fruit bodies found; from 1.8 to 4.2 cm in diameter, stipe 6 to 7 cm long and 3.5 to 8 mm in diameter; gills L = 54 (the largest pileus); SP very faint, possibly whitish, oac color could not be determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":51273,"consensus_name":"Dermoloma josserandii var. josserandii","location_id":739,"location_name":"Zadnja Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":579142},{"id":224004,"type":"observation","date":"2015-11-28","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.6989,"created_at":"2015-11-28T17:12:03.000Z","updated_at":"2015-11-28T23:05:24.000Z","number_of_views":49,"last_viewed":"2023-09-16T20:02:15.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003e1.

Bot_926/2015_DSC9744\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHabitat: Alpine valley, semiruderal grassland in front of a farm house; shallow, calcareous ground; flat terrain; partly sunny; cold place in shade of mountain during winter months; exposed to direct rain, average precipitations ~ 3.000 mm/year, average temperature 7 \u0026#8211; 9 deg C, elevation 560 m (1.850 feet), alpine phytogeographical region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubstratum: stump of a cut down, old Juglans regia in its final disintegration stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlace: Lower Trenta valley, between villages Soča and Trenta, near farm house Skokar, Trenta 2, right bank of river Soča, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia EC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments: This is my second observation where I measured spores and the second time where they are definitely wider than they should be for M. mucida  (see graph \u0026#8216;Measured spore dimensions and data from literature\u0026#8217; in this observation and compare album Multiclavula mucida \u0026#8211; I/ observation No.157303). Measured spores originated from tiny but clear spore pint produced by the sporocarps. All sources I found consistently state that spore width should not exceed 3.0 (3.2) μm. According to the key in Ref.:(4), only three other Multiclavula species (among 13 treated) fit to the spore dimensions of this observation: M. fossicola, which is terrestrial and has larger basidia (see MycoBank), M. coronilla, which is also terrestrial and M. clara, which is not white but pale orange. In addition MycoBank disagrees with Ref.4. in stating M. fossicola maximal spore width no more than 2.7(3.0) microns. Therefore the measured spore width remains a secret to me and casts some doubt in the determination. Sporocarps also seem quite frequently branched, more than stated in most sources for typical Multiclavula mucida. Substrate is also interesting.
