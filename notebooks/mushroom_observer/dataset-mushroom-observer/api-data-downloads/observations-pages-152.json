Once before I posted G. Lucidum now known as G. curtsii in the good old USA, and a novice like myself made mention that he had never found one and that perhaps I was mistaken due to his never finding one.  The same person also made comments about other species being found in Northeast Pa. being rare and uncommon.  The species he was refferring to is Tricholoma flavovirens.  I and my friends have found this particular species in at least seven different locations. To that person!\u003cbr /\u003e\n     Now to my point!  Please do not make generalzations about which you know little or nothing.  There are only a few people in Wyoming Valley who have a decent knowledge of mushrooms.  The majority of mycophiles are simply concerned with edible mushrooms which they were taught to pick as youngsters, and do not concern themselves with unknowns. As you can see I\u0026#8217;m kinda irate right now. I don\u0026#8217;t like pretensous people, and I especially don\u0026#8217;t like Plagarists. This should create some buzz.  Hell.
