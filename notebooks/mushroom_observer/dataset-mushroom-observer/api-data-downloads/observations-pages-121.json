It has a strong odor, similar to many mushrooms that grow on wood; but stronger and a little bit cheesy-sweet maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdibility: I tried a little bit at first, fried in the frying pan (overcooked just to be safe); It was gummy and the taste was nice, but the meat proved to be very hard. I think i ate about 15 grams of it at first. No harm came to me, so today (after 2 days) i cooked the rest in the oven. I used all that was left of the mushroom (sliced thin, so it would be easy to chew), mixed with goat cheese, one potato, little bit of onion, little bit of garlic,  olive oil , parsley, pepper, basil, oregano and bay; all with a sliced tomato on top in a glass cooking pot. Added a little water and cooked for 30 minutes. I ate the result half an hour ago, it was delicious.
