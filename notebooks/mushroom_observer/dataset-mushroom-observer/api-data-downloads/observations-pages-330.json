Each test pit was dug to a depth of two feet, and filled with sunstrate. Early last year I also added smallish chunks of mahoghany and topped off with poplar shavings. Each pit was covered with wire and heavy burlap[ sacks over the top of that to provide some shade. We had the wettest year in recorded history last year and the pits were frequently inundated. Anyway, as of this morning I have 3 mushrooms.

The small cups seen here lack reddish hairs on the margins as described for M. chateri; 2. M. chateri is listed as a summer/fall species; 3.
