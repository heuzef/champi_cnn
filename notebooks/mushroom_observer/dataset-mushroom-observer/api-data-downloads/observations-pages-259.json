Basically, these were growing in pure, free-flowing sand, like one usually finds on an ocean beach or in a coastal sand dune.  I couldn\u0026#8217;t think of a harsher local environment to support the growth of any mycorrhizal fungus, let alone such large fruiting bodies \u0026#8212; a desert-like open area, totally exposed to the sun, and lacking adequate levels of both moisture and nutrients.  Only the caps were showing above the surface, the stipes were largely (60-80%) buried deep in the substrate.  I simply inserted my hands up to my wrists into the sand and scooped them up.  Both pitch pine and oaks were in the vicinity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDescription\u003c/b\u003e:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026gt; Off-white, plano-convex to planar cap of the older specimen is 10 cm wide and 1 cm thick in the middle,  partially covered with the peeling, thin and uniform layer of a felted, cream-colored volval material; there are no visible warts or raised patches of UV; the exposed cuticle below is bald and smooth, but not shiny.  The younger fruitbody\u0026#8217;s plano-convex cap is totally and evenly covered with the the off-white UV material.  The cap margins are appendiculate and decorated with torn and ragged pieces of a PV.  \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026gt; The gills are 1.1-1.2 cm wide (older fb), cream to ochraceous-cream, sub-distant, with plentiful lamellulae of various lengths; the short gills are rounded sub-truncate to attenuate.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026gt; The stipe of the older specimen is 12.5 cm long, more or less equal, with a flaring apex (2.6 cm wide),  becoming slightly constricted directly below (1.9 cm wide min), then gradually expanding from mid-point toward the base (2.5 cm wide max), and getting constricted again in the base (2.3 cm), thus giving the impression of a bulb, whereas there is actually none (see pix).  The stipe of the younger fruitbody is sub-clavate, terminating in a pointy but short turnip-shaped bulb (see pix).  The torn remnants of the partial veil are apical.

The amplified region is between LSU0F and LR7 primers.  The amplicon was sequenced with a combination of two forward reads \u0026#8212; LSU0F and LR3R.  The obtained sequence is a joined contig of 1410 bps.  The sequence has been uploaded to this post.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe legible portion of the sequence starts from the ITS4 primer area and ends at the LR7 primer, which was seen and edited out.  I was barely able to connect the two long reads near the LR3 primer area because of the subpar peak shape at the 3\u0026#8217; end of the LSU0F read.  Both reads had a 1-base frameshift heterogeneity, which required extensive correction of base calling at the end of the LSU0F read, but, thankfully, not so much in the other read.\u003cbr /\u003e\nA BLASTn search if the full-sequence gave nothing closer than 92.8% in pairwise similarity.  A BLASTn of the forward read (the first 672 bps of the sequence) gave accession #MH620285 derived from a collection made in Florida as the top hit at 99.3% similarity.  There is no question it is the same species.  The 2nd from top hit was only ~93% similar.  This Lepidella may look a bit generic, but it\u0026#8217;s a very distinct phylogenetic species. LSU is a good barcoding locus for Lepidellas because they are a very old lineage of \u003ccite\u003eAmanita\u003c/cite\u003e.  The ITS would also be a good barcode as long as sequencing doesn\u0026#8217;t involve Sanger methodology.
