It appears to have perithecioid ascomata with occasionally papillate apex, cellular pseudoparaphyses, bitunicate (hope so) and clavate/cylindrical 8-spore asci, ascospores with pigmentation and several septa and peridium composed of a few layers of cells. Thus it possibly belongs to fungi order Pleosporales Luttr. ex M.E. Barr. This order comprises tens of families and thousands of species. I searched for species, which stain decaying wood reddish/purplish. I browsed through short descriptions of about 160 species studied in the paper of Zhang et al. (2009) (Table:1). Several species, which stain substratum reddish, are cited, but none fits to this observation. It is also possible that my assumption about Pleosporales is completely wrong and this find is something totally different. Hard to manage is also the fact that the traditional taxonomy based exclusively on morphology has been overturned drastically by recent molecular studies. Hense proper naming of species (even genera and families) is confusing for an amateur. Unfortunately, there was no response from AscoFrance forum either.

This specimen was originally located by Sam Landes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have found what appears to be the same fungus five times in three Georgia counties – four times in the last two months of 2017, three of those in disparate locations in the woods behind my house.  I have found the fungus once on white oak (this observation), three times on pine (two of those loblolly, the other too degraded to be sure).  I have added all 5 observations to MO (SEE LIST BELOW).  MycoPortal lists 8 observations in 5 states between 1913 and 2013, including one on Mushroom Observer.  Jacob Kalichman recently added one (304291) from Tennessee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, the only observation before 2015 that mentions the striking elastic nature of the fungus was the one posted on Mushroom Observer in 2013 (153146) by V. Parker in North Carolina: “Fruit body is flexible and pulls apart like gum or putty.”  I cannot find any other mention of elastic polypores anywhere on google.  Yet it is so striking in the field!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother interesting feature of the fungus is the way it permeates the entire log, making much of it so soft and sponge-like that one can easily dig in the wood with fingers.

I still don\u0026#8217;t know what inspired me to peel off a small piece of the bark what revealed the tiny fruitbodies. The very young pilei were recognized because several half-decayed pilei of the same species were present on the same trunk. The trunk was also infected by Fomes fomentarius, which commonly grow together with Oudemansiella mucida. Also very slimy pilei speak in favor of this determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn interesting observation: Ref.5., p 491 states that young fruitbodies do not develop huts in no light conditions. This seems not the case with this find. All fruitbodies (even the smallest ones only 2 \u0026#8211; 3 mm tall) had huts in spite of the fact that they grew in total darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe largest fruitbody was 20 mm tall and the hut had 4 mm in diameter the smallest one was 3.1 mm tall and the hut had 0.8 mm in diameter.
