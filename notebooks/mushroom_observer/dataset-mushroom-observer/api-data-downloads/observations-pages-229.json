I couldn\u0026#8217;t be happier! So a friend of mine posted a photo on facebook a couple of hours ago, because he wanted to share the photos he shot with his newly bought camera. A couple of flowers and insects, but also a mushroom. A white mushroom. A white mushroom with pointy scales on the pileus\u0026#8230; And some sort of girdles of squamules on the stipe\u0026#8230; An entirely white mushroom with pointy scales on the pileus and girdles of squamules on the STIPE?! That is Amanita vittadinii!!! Since the very beginning of my Fungi Fever, which has been going for over two decades, I have wanted to see this amazing, very rare amycorrhizal, Mediterranean species that only sporadically pops up in the coastal area of the Netherlands! And it was only 20 minutes away from where I needed to be at that moment?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I immediately messaged my friend to ask for location, which happened to be right around the corner from where he lives. Another very dear friend of mine, with whom I always go mushroom hunting, also said: I am going with you, no matter what! And off we went!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young button was still standing, but two of the larger specimens were already kicked down by kids (those damn kids\u0026#8230;). It did mean that I can take one of the specimens home for in my herbarium :) Nothing lost!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis awesome Amanita is rarely seen in the Netherlands, deemed extremely rare and listed as Near Threatened on the Dutch Red List (Arnolds \u0026amp; Veerkamp, 2008).
