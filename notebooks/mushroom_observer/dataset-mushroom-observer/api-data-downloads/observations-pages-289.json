The reproductive structures were not delicate themselves, but their attachment to the substrate was, falling off very easily. They were attached to the substrate via a thin white mat that was reminiscent of stretched white adhesive putty or tack.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMicroscopically, I did not observe any hyphae or sexual reproductive structures.

This latter area  is thick, cork-like, and has vertically oriented cleavages within the flesh, giving an appearance of closely packed human-teeth.  The flesh along the cleavages are a cream-white.  AFTER WETTING:  The top changes to a darker grey with dark brown, worm-shaped runners.   The cleavages turn a dark cerulean blue.  The rest of the flesh becomes a darker rust-brown.  (NOTE:  It would appear these cleavages may represent individual fruit bodies which have fused, forming a larger specimen.  This would also help to explain the irregular shape of the cap).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpines:\tVery thin, ~1-3mm long, very close, crowded with some overlapping.  Spines near the cap top are more like “nubs”, whereas the ones furthest down are the longest.  The thicker part of the spine is attached to the flesh (cap \u0026amp; stipe), tapering to a sharp point.  Color is off-white along the spine surface, and pale grey (perhaps blue) along the sides.  The spines cease near the base of the stipe, roughly even with the area covered by the thickest moss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStipe:\t~1-2” long, tapered, somewhat eccentric,  shape conforms roughly to that of the cap.

Inner area:  Predominant color is rusty brown, getting darker towards the stipe end.

Gills are cream, with frequent forking near the stipe and also right at the margin; occasional sub-gills are present.

Mass spore color is white to cream; spore length: 6.8-7.8(8.2), width: (5.7)5.9-6.7(7.0) (n=20); maximum wart height averages about 0.16 microns, warts are incompletely connected (Woo B1-C1) (stained with IKI, not Melzer’s). The flesh does not discolor when cut. I’ve found this species in three widely separated locations in the region in June and July, always among Sitka Spruce (with or without hemlock and grand fir; hardwoods have rarely been present in the vicinity). The observed characteristics are consistent with those for R. brunneola as described by Thiers (1997) and by Roberts (2007; Russulas of Southern Vancouver Island Coastal Forests).
