mild late October 2013. Undisturbed dry area on west side of fallen tree, oak maple or sycamore, possibly. No area rainfall in more than 10 days,ground cool but dry,area heavily shaded, but fungi could produce clear, water-like moisture, when pressure applied. Fungi left out for spore printing on white paper with absorbing underground. After white paper dried no spore print noted possible white? Fungi did not dry out after 3days at room temp. Although less moist, drying didn\u0026#8217;t seem likely. Specimen frozen instead. \u003cbr /\u003e\nThis fungi appeared to look like Pleurotus ostreatus from a distance. Body seemed decaying but smell was mild slightly \u0026#8220;wet lock room-ish\u0026#8221;  (for lack of better terms) although moist and gelatinous the structural composition was firm without tissue sloughing one would expect on a \u003cbr /\u003e\nwaterlogged, decaying object. \u003cbr /\u003e\nUnderside had venation that gave the loose appearance of widely spaced gills that consolidated radially to form centrally located short stalk. Margins of underside contained projections much like toothed fungi. Will send specimen to any scientist willing to id to satisfy personal curiosity.
