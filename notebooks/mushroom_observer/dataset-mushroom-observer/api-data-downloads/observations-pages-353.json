Kreisel, due to Smarda’s Vascellum distinction of a paper-like diaphragm separating the gleba from the subgleba. Among the distinctive characters defining species within Vascellum, Kreisel added eucapillitium being replaced by a dominance of paracapillitium within the gleba tissue, and a reduced pseudocolumella (Kreisel 1963, Larsson 2008). This North American species, Lycoperdon curtisii, has been considered identical to European collections of Vascellum pratense (Pers.) Kreisel by Hollós, except that V. curtisii has a thinner diaphragm, a smaller subgleba, and is overall reduced in size (Kreisel 1963, Ponce de Leon 1970). However, there are many features that distinguish these two species as being different. For one, the spore ornamentation seen with SEM is remarkably different between Lycoperdon curtisii and L. pratense, not to mention the slight difference in spore size, and the striking difference in overall size. In addition, the type for the genus Vascellum, V. depressum (Bonord.) F. Šmarda, has been accepted as a synonym of Lycoperdon pratense Pers. (Larsson 2008). This transfer reduces the genus Vascellum to synonymy with Lycoperdon. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\tThe ML tree produced in this analysis shows Vascellum species (now in Lycoperdon) as a monophyletic clade within the Lycoperdon clade, with 92% bootstrap and 100% PP. In support of the claims above, Vascellum curtisii is placed within this Vascellum clade, and shows that it is distinct from Lycoperdon pratense. Two California specimens identified as Lycoperdon curtisii (SSJ 247, and SSJ 400) are distinct from two GenBank sequences identified as Vascellum curtisii (HQ235048, and HQ235043), representing material from both NC and HI, respectively. This suggests that additional analysis on many specimens from multiple locations coupled with multi loci gene analysis will be necessary to further clarify the taxonomic position of Lycoperdon curtisii within the Lycoperdaceae and better understand the nature of this puffball.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":371,"consensus_id":15189,"consensus_name":"Lycoperdon curtisii","location_id":73,"location_name":"CYO Retreat Center, 2136 Bohemian Highway, Occidental, Sonoma Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1108865},{"id":388908,"type":"observation","date":"2019-05-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.49505,"created_at":"2019-10-22T01:03:13.000Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T01:03:16.000Z","number_of_views":24,"last_viewed":"2023-09-16T10:11:02.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound just west of a pile of boulders.

Having a small size and lack of a subgleba, it resembles a Bovista species. With a similar morphology and somewhat overlapping in habitat of Bovista aestivalis and Bovista plumbea, these three puffballs can be confused easily. In comparison to Bovista aestivalis, Lycoperdon dermoxanthum has a darker green gleba, a longer pedicel on the spores, more coarsely verrucose-ornamented spores, and a subgleba that is almost always absent. Both of these species have similar exoperidium and endoperidium characteristics, both have abundant pores of various size, and spores that are about 3.5-4.5 m. In Bovista aestivalis, mature gleba tissue near the endoperidium wall will have Lycoperdon-type eucapillitium, with Intermediate-type in the center of the gleba. The gleba of Lycoperdon dermoxanthum has both Lycoperdon-type and Intermediate-type in the center of the gleba. Mature gleba tissue from both the center and outer extremities needs to be examined in order to reduce the possibilities of misidentification. Older specimens can easily be misidentified when gleba tissue is absent. The habitat for both of these species overlaps in California, yet Lycoperdon dermoxanthum seems to be more abundant along the north coast. These two puffballs were recently shown to be unrelated in phylogenetic analysis (Bates 2004, Larsson 2008), regardless of their similar morphology and habitat. Lycoperdon dermoxanthum can appear similar to Bovista plumbea in the field, with a cracked to smooth exoperidium ornamentation and similar coloration. However, older Bovista plumbea specimens have a metallic grey tinted endoperidium, and very long pedicels on the spores, sometimes up to 11 µm long. A simple check under the microscope will rule out B. plumbea specimens by looking for small pedicels versus very long ones. Lycoperdon dermoxanthum is placed in thee different locations in this ITS sequence analysis. This suggests that additional genes should be sequenced to further clarify the taxonomic position of Lycoperdon dermoxanthum amongst the other Lycoperdaceae. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaterial Examined: CALIFORNIA, Alpine Co.: Alpine Lake, State Highway 4, gregarious on moist sandy soil near pines, September 1992, H.D.

Lycoperdon lloydianum will detach from the soil when mature and roll around in the environment dispersing spores. The gasterocarps will persist in the environment for up to a year. Growing in rings, caespitose, in groups, or solitary.

A good microscope with oil emersion capability at high power is necessary for identifying eucapillitium versus paracapillitium from various parts of the gleba. One main distinction that sets Lycoperdon lloydianum apart from other diaphragm-forming puffballs is the unique feature of eucapillitium growing out from the diaphragm into the gleba. Lycoperdon pratense and Lycoperdon lloydianum are very similar in outward appearance, which can cause confusion and misidentification among them. Lycoperdon pratense has non-poroid eucapillitium that is scarce to absent, and can be found only along the endoperidium wall in mature gasterocarps, as long as gleba tissue is still present. As well, Lycoperdon pratense has a wide and very well developed diaphragm that can be seen earlier in development than that in Lycoperdon lloydianum (Ponce de Leon 1970, Bates 2004). Both of these grassland species have been collected together in the same habitat. Close examination of the diaphragm and growth of the eucapillitium is necessary for proper treatment of these species. Lycoperdon curtisii remains small in size (under 20 mm broad) and has Lycoperdon-type eucapillitium that can be found along the periphery of the endoperidium wall. This small puffball should be easier to separate from Lycoperdon lloydianum collections due to smaller size when mature, reduced subgleba, and smaller globose spores. Based on ITS, the ML tree includes V. lloydianum and V. intermedium in Lycoperdon. Several of these species have already been transferred; Lycoperdon asperrimum, Lycoperdon curtisii, Lycoperdon bicolor, and Lycoperdon pratense. Whereas others represented in this molecular data set may need to be transferred to Lycoperdon: V. intermedium and V. lloydianum. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaterial Examined: CALIFORNIA, Fresno Co.: Alameda Co.: Oakland, Knowland Park, above the Oakland Zoo, terrestrial in grass, gregarious in rings, 19 April 2012, S.S.

Lycoperdon molle can be distinguished by the granular and spinose exoperidium that does not leave scars on the endoperidium. Under light microscopy, locating the free-floating sterigmata remnants sets this puffball apart from other look-alikes. Lycoperdon umbrinum can resemble Lycoperdon molle at mid-maturity, especially when there is heavy rain and the exoperidium has been wearing away. Dissimilar to Lycoperdon molle, Lycoperdon umbrinum has an exoperidium with darker greenish brown hues, smaller spines that are less dense in arrangement, and a shiny metallic tint to the endoperidium upon reaching maturity. Microscopically, L. umbrinum does not have free-floating sterigmata in wet mounts, and verrucose spores that are smaller than what is found in L. umbrinum (4.0-5.6 µm). Lycoperdon nigrescens is another medium-sized puffball that often becomes mixed up with collections of L. molle and L. umbrinum. The spinose exoperidium of L. nigrescens will leave scars on the endoperidium when they slough off through maturation, a feature parallel to Lycoperdon perlatum. This dark black puffball does not have the shiny metallic tint of L. umbrinum, and does not have the combined granular and spinose furfuraceous exoperidium characters found in L. molle. Microscopically, L. nigrescens has free-floating sterigmata remnants in wet mounts, paracapillitium, small pedicellate spores with verruculose ornamentation. The presence of abundant paracapillitium and the scars on the exoperidium help to separate L. nigrescens from L. umbrinum and L. molle. The results of the ITS ML show that Lycoperdon molle is within the Lycoperdon clade, but distant from each other, and neither have strong support. This suggests that multi loci gene analysis will be necessary to further clarify the taxonomic position of Lycoperdon molle within the Lycoperdaceae. \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaterial Examined: CALIFORNIA, Alameda Co.: Oakland, terrestrial in woods in the Oakland Hills, 2 March 1934, coll. unknown (UCB521367)(UC); Berkeley, Strawberry Canyon, terrestrial, 22 November 1937, coll. unknown (UCB585370)(UC); Oakland, Sequoia Park, terrestrial, 22 November 1937, V.

I think this is called depersonalization. It\u0026#8217;s like seeing yourself from the outside. They also bring a feeling of calm and wellbeing, it\u0026#8217;s hard to feel worried. You look at things and feel like you have just discovered colors, they look bright, everything is surprising and new. You have a lot of thoughts at the same time, they come and go so fast. You lose the notion of time, like it just dissolved with you and now everything outside feels slower. And it seems like all the thoughts you had before you were in that state of mind, they feel like conceived in a rush, by a creature living in a constant rush, apparently going nowhere, but always running desperately. You can also feel like communicating with people tripping with you doesn\u0026#8217;t even need words, while sober people are inaccessible.
