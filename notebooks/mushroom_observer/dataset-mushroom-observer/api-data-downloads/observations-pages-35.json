At about 3800 ft. elevation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are a weird one. quite a good collection of these was found, about 2 dozen bodies.  These are bright lime-green when young, and become tan-yellow as they age.  The caps are rugulose, at all ages, and never striate.  Not sure, but they don\u0026#8217;t appear hygrophanous, but that is hard to tell with the color changes, and rough surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe put these under the scope quickly, and confirmed that they are Conocybe.

The lecythiform cheilocystidia are obvious, and this is clearly a Conocybe.  Also along with this no pleurocystidia were obs., the basidia were 4-spored, also separated by spacer cells, and no reactions to Meltzer\u0026#8217;s were obs. anywhere (spores or tissues).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is on a section of cap surface at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The cap sruface here is curious, not quite clearly cellular as you would expect.  It is a randomize surface of inflated and filiform hyphae, more of less lying down on the surface.  I would expect the clear hymeniform surface for Conocybe, but this one is weird.  Not clearly cellular or not.  No surface gelatin was obs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of the stipe surface near the apex at 400x in KOH.  Here you can a clump of caulocystidia.  There are multiple kinds of cystidia there, some clavate, some lageniform and wavy, and many long filiform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth micro-shot is of some spores from the stipe surface at 1000x in KOH.  Here the spores are smooth, ellipsoid, brown and with a germ pore.  They are quite large, roughly 18 um long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this they seem to be at least in the section Candidae of Conocybe, which makes them related to the Conocybe apala variations.
