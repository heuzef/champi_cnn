Today was a potluck for the Clackamas County Farm Forestry Association, which last year awarded Paul Bishop Sr. its coveted Tree Farmer of the Year award. For those who don\u0026#8217;t already know, Clackamas County (county seat: Oregon City) annually produces more Christmas trees than 45 other states. I met Paul Bishop Sr. 33 years ago during a forage to his tree farm held by the North American Truffling Society. It was here that I started finding these very dark Tubers, especially when dried, which typically fruit during the spring. Dr. James Trappe finally compared my collections with the remaining potion of the original collection of Tuber gibbosum Hark. and announced with some surprise that the original collected material from California in March, April, and June also fruits in Oregon. He further stated that under a scanning electron microscope, Tuber gibbosum has pinched spores, while the material incorrectly identified for some 30 years as Tuber gibbosum, now renamed as Tuber oregonense, has plump spores.

The fungi from the first two photos have greenish heads and stalks, but the third fungus is more reddish brown.  I’ve spent a significant amount of time searching the internet trying to identify these specimen, but it’s hard to tell what information is accurate, and what is outdated, or just plain false.  Apparently, some mycologists believe Leotia atrovirens is simply just Leotia lubrica that has been colonized by a fungal parasite known as Hypomyces leotiicola.  The fungi in my  photos certainly appear to be hosting  some sort of  parasite.  This could explain why the third fungus isn’t green; if it wasn‘t colonized, or colonized to a lesser extent.  I am still very unsure about what it is, exactly, that I have found.
