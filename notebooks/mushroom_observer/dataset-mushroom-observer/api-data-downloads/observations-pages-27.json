However, it appears that this species has now been identified a three separate but similar species (rachodes, olivieri, and brunneum).  See \u003ca href=\"http://www.svims.ca/council/Chloro.htm\"\u003ehttp://www.svims.ca/council/Chloro.htm\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the specimens I found are C. brunneum, because the ring has only one flaring edge, rather than two, and the base bulb does seem to have a bit of a ridge.  [But I have not been able to find a good picture of what is referred to as the double-edged ring, so I am not absolutely certain what that is describing – if anyone has a good picture of that, I’d like to see it.]  Everything, except the movable nature of the ring, discussed below, fits the descriptions, though I am also a bit unsure of what it being described as a ridge on the base of the bulb (so I have pictures of that too).  Habitat was in needle duff under some type of stiff needled evergreen (not a white pine), base bulb not a sac like as in Amanitas, but more of a white mass.  (There is no greenish color in the gills, the upper stipe is hollow, and there is some red/saffron staining of the flesh when cut.  When the gills dry, they do have the crinkled appearance that I think is typical of C. molybdites, but that may be common to all of these.)  Spore print is white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason I am posting this is because both C. brunneum and rachodes are described as having a ring that is movable on the stipe.  All of my specimens have rings that are well attached, not movable.  So I am wondering whether there is something else that these might be that should be considered.  The descriptions of these two species are below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChlorophyllum brunneum (Farlow \u0026amp; Burt) Vellinga\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCAP 10–20 cm wide, convex becoming flat in age; disc cinnamon brown, smooth; margin colored like the disc, smooth at first, soon breaking up concentrically into smooth upturned scales with white fibrous flesh showing between the scales. GILLS free, white, becoming red or brown when bruised, darkening in age, close, edges finely fringed, in two or three tiers. SPORE PRINT white. STALK 10–20 cm long—about equal to the diameter of the cap, top 10–25 mm thick, club shaped, base with an abrupt bulb having a flattened top and often a ridged perimeter, stuffed, smooth, white, surface darkening when bruised, cut flesh staining reddish or saffron.

CAP CUTICLE compact cemented hymeniform layer of clavate to bulbous cells. NOTES Salient features that distinguish C. brunneum from C. rachodes: C. brunneum has a ring with a single edge and its stalk base is an abrupt bulb with a flattened top that often has a ridged perimeter; C. rachodes has a double-edged ring and a stalk base that is either gradually swollen or is a bulb with a sloping top that never has a ridge.

I mentioned the beetle(?) larvae holes throughout the tree with live larvae – I know because I looked closely after laughing at juncos and white crowned sparrows feeding on the freshly sawn slabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top of the tree was rotten and had broken out the previous winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bark was still fairly well attached to the log, but after the slab was cut off the side of the log, sometimes the bark would come loose, and between the two was a sheet of fungus mycelium that was previously the cambium layer under the bark. It had the consistency of thin rolled pie dough, smooth, soft and cold as it draped over my hands.  I put it out of my mind as it had nothing to do with milling lumber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slabs that are cut off the outside of the log I cut into firewood.  Some of the slabs toward the top of the tree are rotten or punky, and I am burning this now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night as I was adding this wood to the fire, I noticed a knot, from a limb I had cut flush with the bark, had been overgrown by fungi. This firewood (Abies Grandis, Grand Fir we call White Fir) has an abundance of one kind of crust fungi, and I now believe these to be the fruiting bodies of the cambium mycelium I noticed as I was sawing the log 8 months ago.  Other photos show the fungi growing from punky wood, and mature shelves on and from the fir stump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, each cut passed through a substantial amount of this sheet of mycelium, and the particles were thoroughly mixed into the sawdust pile.
