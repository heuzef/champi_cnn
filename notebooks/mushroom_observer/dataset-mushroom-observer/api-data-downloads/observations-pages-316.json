If you search for taxon names pertaining to this genus in Index Fungorum for example you will get in return 6.000 different names! In the field the mushrooms shown here had unmistakably unpleasant smell and taste on chemicals (usually called phenolic or carbolic); measured spores fit well to Agaricus xanthodermus; the pilei had typical trapezoid form in vertical section (particularly when young), which also fits to this species. Yet, there are also problems: the habitat is not typical, it should be woods, but I found this fruit bodies in grassland; though the staining after cutting or damaging the fruit bodies was yellowish, it was only very faint, even in the base of the stipe, where it should be immediate and strong chrome-yellow. Stipe base of this observation shows a conspicuous rim and is quite flat at the bottom (marginate-bulbous), which is, according to several sources, typical for Agaricus essettei (now joined to Agaricus silvicola according to IF). Such stipe base may occasionally occur also with Agaricus xanthodermus according to Ref.: 1, and 2.  Interestingly, two months after this observation, in dry state, smell changed completely to pleasant, on spices, similar on celery. However, not on anise or bitter-almonds, which is characteristic for some other species of this genus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, this find could eventually be Agaricus campestris since it was found in grassland, but its spores are larger (6.5-8/4-5.5 or 6.4-7.9/4.4-5.6 according to Ref.: 2). Similar Agaricus essettei Bon (now Agaricus sylvicola) with typical stipe base as found in this observation, also has somewhat larger spores and doesn\u0026#8217;t show trapezoid pilei (at least not according to Ref.: 1). So, Agaricus xanthodermus seems promising, but not certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral pilei found; hut diameter (not expanded) 5-9 cm; stipe 5.5-11 cm long and 14-20 mm in diameter, bulb 28-32 mm diameter, fibrous, very faintly bruising yellowish;  SP abundant, dark brown, oac637.

But it is a rare find in west Slovenia. This observation seems, at least according to available data from Boletus Informaticus database (Ref.: 8), the first one in Posočje region. Pilei are surprisingly soft for a polypore. When fresh they have very distinctive and pleasant smell resembling the smell of Gloeophyllum odoratum. However, this smell fades after some time and disappears completely in dry herbarium samples. It is interesting that young, but also large, seemingly mature pilei do not yet have hymenium developed and do not produce spores (Ref.: 6). In my first attempt I was trying to do microscopy of both in vain. Only after I went back to the site and bring home a very old, hard, almost decaying pileus I found plentiful spores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany pilei were present; pilei semicircular to flabelliform, applanate, also effuse-reflexed and sometimes imbricate and confluent, measuring up to 15 \u0026#215; 9 cm, up to 2 cm thick; trama up to 15 mm thick, pore layer up to 10 mm thick; pilei soft; pores small, slightly bruising brownish; SP rather faint, light ocher, oac 847.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Sony ILCE6000 / Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar E 16-70mm/ f4\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":2703,"consensus_name":"Ischnoderma resinosum","location_id":673,"location_name":"Bovec basin, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":980031},{"id":351243,"type":"observation","date":"2018-12-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.57002,"created_at":"2018-12-16T14:54:09.000Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T15:45:31.000Z","number_of_views":54,"last_viewed":"2022-10-03T11:00:22.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMultiple fruiting bodies beneath mature Douglas fir.
