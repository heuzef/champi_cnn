near Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies grandis, Pinus contorta, mahonia repens. Mycophagy taking place led my to the location. The truffle was found with its top peaking just above mineral soil. The specimen was a very dirty light brown and was very firm as well. The Gleba was unlike any I have seen. It was mostly smooth with only the occasional hole or locule present as a result of a loosely folded area. The brick red Gleba was squiggly looking and without any distinct odor. Hyphae were on the truffles bottom. This specimen was of good size and measured over an inch long. The white columella was only present in the truffles center.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":6571,"consensus_id":263,"consensus_name":"Gautieria monticola","location_id":13662,"location_name":"Shiloh Guard Station, Naples, Boundary Co., Idaho, USA","primary_image_id":633331},{"id":243712,"type":"observation","date":"2016-06-01","latitude":"49.38264","longitude":"75.4025","altitude":1124,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.66643,"created_at":"2016-07-09T18:17:04.000Z","updated_at":"2016-07-09T18:20:00.000Z","number_of_views":17,"last_viewed":"2023-10-13T07:58:52.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eIt is on granitic blocks in pine-tree forest.

It was growing in the corner of a patch of soil in a grocery store parking lot, and looking impressively robust and fleshy despite the lack of any sort of recent rain in the area. There may be sprinklers in the area, though I forgot to check. Very glad to finally see this mushroom for the first time, I was fascinated by the idea of a green-spored mushrooms when first learning about it many years ago!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDescription: the mushrooms were very willing to shed their cap scales on everything they touched, edges of cap very frayed. The gill color of the older two mushrooms was distinctively pale green, while less so for the younger. The spore print of the younger one (not pictured) was surprisingly more cream than anything, with white bits but no hint of green like in the older mushroom\u0026#8217;s print which is pictured. Stipe light above the veil, dark below. Very distinctive dark orange to brown coloration where the caps and stalks were separated, similar to C. rhacodes, noticed about an hour after I picked the mushrooms and inspected them at home.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":3582,"consensus_id":325,"consensus_name":"Chlorophyllum molybdites","location_id":13975,"location_name":"Hanson's Shopping Center on Del Obispo, San Juan Capistrano, Orange Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":633338}],"run_time":1.379481746}
