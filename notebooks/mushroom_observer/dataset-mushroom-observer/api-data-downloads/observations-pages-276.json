Their thallus is crustose or grows within solid rock (endolithic) or it is something in between these two options. These lichens have usually yellow, orange or red apothecia and simple cell spores (Ref.:3). Their similarity to Caloplaca species on macroscopic level causes frequent confusions. However, Caloplaca species have two celled spores (septate spores), which distinguish them from Protoblastenia species with certainty.\u003cbr /\u003e\nProtoblastenia incrustans is a common lichen, but it is certainly many times overlooked. Namely, thallus is usually endolithic and consequently hard to be seen. Its apothecia are very small, from only 200 to 500 microns in diameter (Ref.:3) and can also hardly be seen by naked eye in spite of the fact that they are bright yellow-orange color. Characteristically, its apothecia sit in small pits in the rock. Their surface is from slightly concave to slightly convex shape, most of them are nearly flat. This species is an arctic-alpine element (Ref.:5).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":12985,"consensus_name":"Protoblastenia incrustans","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":851580},{"id":310516,"type":"observation","date":"2018-02-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69319,"created_at":"2018-03-01T11:17:49.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-01T11:46:13.000Z","number_of_views":31,"last_viewed":"2023-12-27T04:00:53.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eWhite spore print\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":437,"consensus_id":29280,"consensus_name":"Chlorophyllum hortense","location_id":17414,"location_name":"Total Petroport Panorama east, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa","primary_image_id":851585},{"id":310517,"type":"observation","date":"2018-02-24","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69319,"created_at":"2018-03-01T11:25:45.000Z","updated_at":"2018-03-01T11:25:49.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2024-02-05T03:37:54.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eNo picture of lamellae.
