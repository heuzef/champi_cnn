However, it is very sensitive to air pollution and is hence in strong decline in many places in Europe where it is considered endangered and (mostly) protected. Plants with apothecia became rare.

However, even here some damages due to pollution can be observed (brown dots on apothecia surface \u0026#8211; see arrows on Fig. 11).This lichen has been historically used to treat wounds and modern tests for antibacterial properties have been positive.

This was determined by growing fungus in culture from herbarium sample (Ref.:1). Clonostachys rosea is a common species found on several substrates including other fungi (fungicolous species). It colonizes living plants as an endophyte, can live in ground living as a saprophyte, or lives as a parasite on other fungi or nematodes. It produces several kinds of mycotoxins. It is used in biological pest control on vegetable, mostly for treatment of grey mold (Botrytis cinerea) of tomato and strawberries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long fusiform and septated conidia also observed belong most probably to another fungus belonging to genus Fusarium.

Yet, this typical color pertains only to mature but still fresh aethalia (pictures 10-13). With time cortex becomes darker, almost golden (picture 14), then black inside becomes visible (pictures 15, 16). In next phase cortex become whitish (pictures 17, 18) and finally it disappears and only blackish-reddish-brown spore mass is seen (pictures 19, 20). It is interesting that this find was found only a few meters away of the site where I photographed the same species two years ago (see Album Fuligo septica var. flava \u0026#8211; I, Dec. 2014) (see MO observations #194527).
