The cheilocystidia are tibiiform, long thin necks with capitate ends.  No pleurocystidia were obs.  Basidia are a mixture of 2-spored and 4-spored.  Spores are non-dextrinoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The cap surface is a cutis, with no gelatin, and lots of pileocystidia, which are also tibiiform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of the stipe apex at 400x in KOH.  The caulocystidia are also tibiiform, only obs. at the apex, not at the base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth micro-shot is of the spores from the stipe apex at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are ellipsoid, lightly roughened, no germ pore, no plage.  The apr. ave. size is 14 \u0026#215; 7.5 um, but as you can even see by eye, there is a wide distribution of sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe id here might be a little controversial, depending on how much you care about splitting Galerina details, at least in section Tubariopsis (and I\u0026#8217;m sure you know who you are\u0026#8230;).  The cystidia, and the non-dextrinoid spores clearly put this into section Tubariopsis.  Also with the fairly light stipes, and the spore shape and lightly roughened, this pushes it towards G. clavata.  But then in most sources this gets split as with 4-spored basidia and apr. 11-13 um long spores you get G. clavata, and with 2-spored basidia and apr. 14-17 um long spores you get G. subclavata.  But in Haan and Waylen they take it a little further, and say that also with pileocystidia you get G. subclavata, and laking pileocystidia you get G. clavata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut here is the problem, these have pileocystidia, and at least some 4-spored basidia.  The spores are apr. on ave. 14 um long, which kinda pushes it toward G. subclavata.  So, with that and the pileocystidia, I\u0026#8217;m calling these G. subclavata.  But this kinda makes it an obs. of this species with some 4-spored basidia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso to add to this, there is the G. clavata of California, which is different than these at least, with no pileocystidia, and clearly 4-spored basidia.  But also those have spores sizes of 9.5 um long, with usually less than a 1um spread on spore size.  Where here the spore length is 14 um on ave, but there is about a 2-3 um width on the spore size.  I still need to find a good collection of what is clearly G. clavata from Europe to compare, if this is enough of a difference.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":25511,"consensus_name":"Galerina subclavata","location_id":409,"location_name":"Bossy, Switzerland","primary_image_id":130688},{"id":62185,"type":"observation","date":"2010-11-06","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.57736,"created_at":"2011-01-12T13:07:14.000Z","updated_at":"2021-07-31T20:21:07.000Z","number_of_views":173,"last_viewed":"2024-03-01T22:36:10.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound on small woody debris in mixed forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.

is a jelly-like resupinate on wood of coyote bush.  It has an \u0026#8220;auricularioid\u0026#8221; basidium, and it starts with a little sac-like structure to the side of what will become the mature metabasidium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the second collection of this species from Pt. Reyes.   The first I called Helicobasidium, but really didn\u0026#8217;t spend the time to look at it closely. You can see it here:  \u003ca href=\"http://pmb.berkeley.edu/~bruns/tour/mycoblitz2.html\"\u003ehttp://pmb.berkeley.edu/~bruns/tour/mycoblitz2.html\u003c/a\u003e.  After spending more time with this collection I think Helicogloea is more likely because the basidium is straight and seems to originate from probasidium with a sac-like appendage.  Also now that I have read a little more,  I don\u0026#8217;t think Helicobasidium would be as jelly-like.   Achroomyces (Platygloea) is similar but lacks the sac-like appendage to probasidium. Using Chen and Oberwinker\u0026#8217;s 2000 key it seems to fall near H. langerheimii and H. variabilis.  The spore size fits the latter better, but that species is known only from S. America, so I\u0026#8217;ve gone with the more commonly applied name.  It may be something different, however. Another image of it from Europe looks similar to this \u003ca href=\"http://www.mycokey.com/MycoKeySolidState/species/Helicogloea_lagerheimii.html\"\u003ehttp://www.mycokey.com/...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to looking at this specimen was that I kept it wet with paper towels overnight and had it spore-print onto a glass slide.  When I looked at this fresh material it was easy to find mature basidia and repeating spores.   After drying it was hard to find the specimen at all, as it dried down to a thin, transparent film, and when I looked it the dried material microscopically I only found probasidia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have cultures of it now derived from spore drops onto MMN agar. It initially grew as a very sparse, almost invisible mycelium, but has become a little more dense and fluffy with time (or mating?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wood that it is on does seem to be colonized by some short of Xylariaceous ascomycete.  It is possible that this is its host rather than the wood. Apparently mycoparasitisim is common in Achroomyces.  I\u0026#8217;m not clear whether that is also true for Helicogloea. The wood was very well decayed, and as Davin noticed from the photo, infested by termites.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":768,"consensus_id":25544,"consensus_name":"Helicogloea langerheimii","location_id":1559,"location_name":"Limantour Rd., Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":131717},{"id":62529,"type":"observation","date":"2011-01-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.8321,"created_at":"2011-01-20T00:09:53.000Z","updated_at":"2016-09-03T07:04:52.000Z","number_of_views":39,"last_viewed":"2023-12-28T06:25:46.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound under live oak, pine, poplar, willow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed staining, no odor.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":31753,"consensus_name":"Agaricus bernardi","location_id":86,"location_name":"Sycamore Grove Park, Livermore, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":131730},{"id":62530,"type":"observation","date":"2011-01-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.71413,"created_at":"2011-01-20T00:11:17.000Z","updated_at":"2011-01-20T00:11:19.000Z","number_of_views":22,"last_viewed":"2024-01-05T22:04:20.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound under willow.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":16720,"consensus_name":"Coprinellus impatiens","location_id":86,"location_name":"Sycamore Grove Park, Livermore, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":131732},{"id":62531,"type":"observation","date":"2011-01-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.71414,"created_at":"2011-01-20T00:12:39.000Z","updated_at":"2011-01-20T00:12:40.000Z","number_of_views":30,"last_viewed":"2024-01-04T08:23:08.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound under live oak, pine, poplar, willow.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":5518,"consensus_name":"Lentinellus ursinus var. ursinus","location_id":86,"location_name":"Sycamore Grove Park, Livermore, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":131734},{"id":62532,"type":"observation","date":"2011-01-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.81592,"created_at":"2011-01-20T00:13:20.000Z","updated_at":"2011-01-20T02:04:19.000Z","number_of_views":21,"last_viewed":"2023-09-02T17:57:51.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound under pine.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":494,"consensus_name":"Suillus pungens","location_id":86,"location_name":"Sycamore Grove Park, Livermore, Alameda Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":131736},{"id":62533,"type":"observation","date":"2011-01-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.61467,"created_at":"2011-01-20T00:15:37.000Z","updated_at":"2011-01-20T08:49:25.000Z","number_of_views":69,"last_viewed":"2024-03-17T09:01:46.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound under live oak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least this is the common enough Tubaria in California, with the fibrous partial veil, that leaves veil remnants on the ring on the stipe.
