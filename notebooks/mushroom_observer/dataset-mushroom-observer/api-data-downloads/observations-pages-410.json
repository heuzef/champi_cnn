Dimensions of spores inclined me toward Didymium melanospermum (Pers.) T. Macbr. at first. However, other traits, particularly furrowed stalks, whitish stalk color (should be dark to black) and presence of lime in them (it should be absent), changed my initial supposition in favor to similar Didymium squamulosum (Alb. \u0026amp; Schwein.) Fr. in spite of the fact that measured spore dimensions doesn\u0026#8217;t fit so nicely to the second option. Another discrepancy of the find (related to booth species) is the fact that vast majority of the sporocarps appeared sessile, while they should normally be distinctly stalked and only rarely \u0026#8216;sessile\u0026#8217;. According to literature Didymium squamulosum is considered a very variable species and apparently sessile sporocarps are found occasionally too, so they may not be a severe argument against this determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDescription: Sporocarps up to 1.1 mm tall, most of them seemingly sessile having rudimentary stalks hidden in strongly umbicilate sporocysts below; only a few distinctly stalked; sporocysts sub-globose or oblate, 0.6-1 mm in diameter, when wet bluish-gray, half dry pale-gray, when dry white; with simple, membranous, colorless to light-yellowish, translucent peridium covered by a thick layer of crystalline lime; crystals usually larger than spores; (hypo)columella present, flattened, perimeter about 1/3 or slightly less of the sporocysts perimeter; white to beige, light brownish (best seen in transparent light); capillitium thin, scantily branched with rare, small nodular swellings; attached to peridium. Stalks short, mostly hidden; some distinct but not longer than 2/3 of sporocysts diameter, longitudinally striate, No confluent plasmodial form observed at the site of stalk attachment to substrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamera: \u003cbr /\u003e\nAmScope MA500 digital camera on Olympus CH20; pictures: 1M, 3M, 4M, 5M. 6M and 12M.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSony ILCE6000 on trinocular stereomicroscope Novex RZ, Holland; pictures: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7M, 8M, 9M, 10M and 11M.\u003cbr /\u003e\nNikon D700 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8; pictures: 1, 2, 3 and 4.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":43356,"consensus_name":"Didymium squamulosum","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":1311998},{"id":448412,"type":"observation","date":"2009-06-03","latitude":"46.9377","longitude":"-71.3253","altitude":246,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.30945,"created_at":"2021-03-01T13:24:55.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-07T17:41:51.000Z","number_of_views":78,"last_viewed":"2024-03-29T11:16:01.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eArachnopeziza aurelia\u003cbr /\u003e\nRécolteur : Jules Cimon\u003cbr /\u003e\nDate de récolte: 2009.06.03\u003cbr /\u003e\nSubstrat: écorce, bois nu, feuilles et ailes de fruit d\u0026#8217;érable\u003cbr /\u003e\nSubiculum blanchâtre\u003cbr /\u003e\nAsques cylindriques, à 8 spores bisériées, avec crochet à la base et appareil apical fortement amyloïde, 90-100 \u0026#215; 9-10 µm\u003cbr /\u003e\nParaphyses cylindriques, septées, contenant des globules, 105-115 \u0026#215; 2-3 µm, dépassant les asques de 5-10 µm\u003cbr /\u003e\nSpores ellipsoïdes-fusoïdes, à 3 septa, avec appendice gélatineux facilement inaperçu aux extrémités, légèrement jaunâtres en H2O, 19-25 \u0026#215; 4-5 µm, 21,8 \u0026#215; 4,3 µm en moyenne(20 spores), Q = 5,07\u003cbr /\u003e\nMedulla formé de cellules polymorphes, ellipsoïdes, globuleuses à ± cylindriques\u003cbr /\u003e\nPoils cylindriques, septés, contenus dans une gaine de cristaux jaune-roux vif, jusqu\u0026#8217;à 300 µm x 4-5 µm\u003cbr /\u003e\nSubiculum formé d\u0026#8217;hyphes à paroi mince, hyalines à légèrement jaunâtres, parfois finement incrustées, 3-4 µm de diam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIdentification : John Plischke \u0026amp; Dick Korf\u003cbr /\u003e\nTexte: J.
