Upon pushing it out of the way I noticed small red blotches that I initially took to be a lichen. Once I had a chance to examine this more closely the first things I noticed were that the small blotches lacked structures typical to lichen and that the context was easily sliced with a razor. At this point I thought this was an asco. But, a smash mount of material revealed what appear to be basidia; clubs with slightly bowed pointed spikes sticking out of the apices. I laid an inverted patch of bark with fruit bodies attached onto a slide. The next day a white spore print was evident. At 400x (in Congo red) cylindrical to allantoid spores were found (7-8 \u0026#215; 2-2.5). These are likely basidiospores. But, also seen in the same mount were larger broadly ellipsoid structures (10-12 \u0026#215; 6-8; spores?) each with two large guttules and appearing to verge on septate (one septum). Perhaps this fungus had parasitized a lichen or some other fungus? Also seen in the mounts at 400x were variously inflated sack-like structures that appear to feature finely granular contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFruit bodies are ~2-3 mm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lichen was observed on the same branch, likely a species of Lecanora.
