Seem like oyster mushrooms, just different than I\u0026#8217;ve seen with the long stem, the longest of which was about 4 inches. 5% KOH negative on stipe, cap and context.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":4282,"consensus_id":2643,"consensus_name":"Hypsizygus ulmarius","location_id":6102,"location_name":"Jasper Co., Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":384625},{"id":151921,"type":"observation","date":"2013-11-10","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.90719,"created_at":"2013-11-13T00:07:32.000Z","updated_at":"2014-07-12T16:16:21.000Z","number_of_views":32,"last_viewed":"2024-02-07T23:16:04.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003ePicked in red pine plantation.
