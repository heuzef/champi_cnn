It was growing in turf next to a small vineyard with no woody vegetation nearby.  The flat cap was almost round (8.8 \u0026#215; 8.2cm) and was an off-white color.  The cap was smooth and the margin with smooth.  Stipe length was 15.0cm with the smallest diameter (1.0cm) in the middle getting a bit larger at the apex and base.  Very little bruising was noted; only turning a faint yellow.  No color change was noted after the application of KOH, NH4OH, and FeSO4 to the inside of a section of the stipe.  After making a spore print (overnight at room temperature), I noticed that the cap and stipe had a few small but vivid maroon spots (see photo).

I have now found these fungi growing twice in my raised bed strawberry gardens.  I don\u0026#8217;t know if this information will help anyone to identify this fungus, but here goes: The soil is an extremely high quality mix of Coco-Loco potting mix by Fox Farm, Semi composted Alpaca manure from a farm on Lookout Mountain, Golden, Colorado, perlite, vermiculite and other premium raised bed pre made potting soil mixes.  Also, the beds were covered over the winter with \u0026#8220;Plankets\u0026#8221; (porous frost covers), and unfortunately the frost covers were left in place too long (all the way through the winter until about April 26th), and many of the strawberry plants died, in part from some kind of fungal disease.  Also, I have pine needles all over the top of the beds to provide a more acidic soil which the strawberries love.  And it works perfect to keep the strawberries off of the soil while they ripen so they never rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t know if leaving the covering in place too long had anything to do with this \u0026#8220;mushroom\u0026#8221; showing up, but wanted to include all of that info just in case it might have any bearing on anyone being able to help me identify what this fungus is.  Can someone please tell me if this is a toxic species, or just some innocuous, non-toxic, harmless species, or maybe even a beneficial fungus?  Obviously the mycelium is all through the beds, as I have found \u0026#8220;fruitings\u0026#8221; of this mushroom twice now in the past 10 days or so.  The temps are about 90 degrees during the day, and drop to around 50 at night, and have been in that range during the fruitings.  I only water the beds every other day, so even though they got too much water in the spring when the frost covers were still on, they are definitely not too wet now.  I am concerned about this fungus being in a bed of plants with fruit that I am ingesting.  Please help me identify this if at all possible.  I hope someone can put to rest any concerns I have.  Plus, it would just be quite interesting to know what mushroom this is.
