But, kind explanation of Mr. Günter Sturm, Germany, having long \u0026#8216;mileage\u0026#8217; in Polyporaceae, and the paper of David (1974), Ref.: (8) convinced me that the correct determination should be Postia subcaesia. Now substratum fits better. Also habitus of the find fits better to the new determination. Pileus of P. caesia is of more uniform colors and never has strongly contrasting colors as in this observation. Another trait, which fits better now, is the fact that the pilei color didn\u0026#8217;t changed distinctly blue when bruised. Nevertheless, spore dimensions still don\u0026#8217;t fit to data from literature. May be Ryvarden\u0026#8217;s comment in Ref.: (7), p 405, regarding distinguishing both species: \u0026#8216;However, there are some disturbing intermediate specimens on hardwoods.\u0026#8217; explains the situation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e((The text of former comments: This beautifully blue polypore may also be Postia subcaesia, syn.: Oligoporus subcaesius. Unfortunately, the distinguishing traits between P. caesia and P. subcaesia seem to be treated quite inconsistently in the literature. Postia caesia should principally thrive on wood of conifers (with rare but well documented exceptions) and should have spores wider than 1.5 μ, while Postia subcaesia is found on broadleaved trees and should have spores narrower than 1.5 μ (as per Refs.:(5), (6) and (1)). Contrary, Ref.: (4) states narrower than 1.5 μ spores for P.. caesi (mistake?). Also the information about spore shape (allantoid versus cylindrical) and pilei size is inconsistently given in different sources. In this observation measured spore width speaks in favor to P. caesia (according to Ref.:(1), (6) and (5)), while substratum doesn\u0026#8217;t.
