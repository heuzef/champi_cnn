getting back to this question.  I looked through the descriptions for S. caerulescens and S. ponderosus, and it turns out the clear difference to look for is that S. caerulescens has an ixotrichoderm, and S. ponderosus has radially aligned interwoven hyphae in a gelatin matrix.  Also the descriptions state that both stain in the base wehn cut (and only the base), but S. caerulescens is blue, and S. ponderosus stains green (green? only green staining boletales I\u0026#8217;ve heard of, and this isn\u0026#8217;t a St. Patrick\u0026#8217;s joke\u0026#8230;).

There are the same size, and look quite a bit like C. pratensis, but they are completely white.  They are non-viscid on cap and stipe.  Largent\u0026#8217;s Hygrophorus of CA mention some white-capped species that look like C. pratensis:  H. cremeicolor has a creamy white cap, and yellow gills; H. angustifolius is all white but with small sized spores; and H. berkeleyi is ivory colored (not sure how to tell the difference between white, ivory and cream really\u0026#8230;), but is moist and slightly viscid.  These were slightly damp, and really non-viscid, and all white, really white-white.  That suggests H. angustifolius, but Larget remarks that it is rare, he didn\u0026#8217;t find it, and he only lists it from Hesler and Smith who mention it under redwoods in coastal CA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3/3/2008 \u0026#8211; looking at this some more here, and got some of it under the scope.  The first micro-shot here is of a gill section, at 100x in KOH.  Sorry about the quality of the photo, I\u0026#8217;ll get better, but here you can see the basidia on each side of the section, and the inter-woven trama in between.  The second micro-shot is on the spores at 1000x in KOH.  Haven\u0026#8217;t figured out how to get this is focus just yet, but you can see spores enough here.  They are sub-globose to drop shaped.  Measuring 10 spores, the ave size is 5.85 \u0026#215; 4.7 um.  This makes these Camarophyllus, but still not sure about the species.  They were found near C. pratensis, and they were very common.  The spore size is consistant with that species, and these might be albino versions of these.  But the shape of the spores, and macro-features are consistant with C. angustifolius, although the spore size is at the large end of the size ranges for that species.  Also C. angustifolius has only been describe by Hesler and Smith, and hasn\u0026#8217;t been seen since, so I don\u0026#8217;t know here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI now have to go and look at C. pratensis and compare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3/6/2008 \u0026#8211; Now having gone a looked at details on C. pratensis, the difference is the color, which is pure white here, and there is a difference in the spore shape and size.  The spores are smaller, but I\u0026#8217;m not sure how consistant this is really.  But also the spore shape is different, here they are more tear-drop shaped, where in C. pratensis the spore are more elliptical.  And that is the main difference as sited in Largent\u0026#8217;s Hygrophorus of CA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I\u0026#8217;m not entirely certain, but there is a difference, and the difference is exactly what is stated in the monograph, so I\u0026#8217;m going to go with it.  But you could say that these might just be an albino variation of C. pratensis.  Also I wasn\u0026#8217;t as careful about the spore size as I could have been, and more should be done with more spores and use of Congo Red to have a careful measurement here.  But I think I\u0026#8217;m going to move on, and leave it as this, others can borrow the dried samples for further study if needed.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":1630,"consensus_name":"Camarophyllus angustifolius","location_id":25,"location_name":"Los Trancos Preserve, Palo Alto, Santa Clara Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":11886},{"id":6908,"type":"observation","date":"2008-02-23","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.80349,"created_at":"2008-02-26T05:05:20.000Z","updated_at":"2012-06-07T06:02:09.000Z","number_of_views":33,"last_viewed":"2023-11-19T13:26:37.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;d found one like these before, but it was soo dried out, it hard to tell much about it.

Found outside the library in the grass.  A whole bunch dotted through the grass, but pretty much invisible until you got down in there.  I saw one in passing, and stopping I found about 100 more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was just grass, no moss, no woody debris of any kind.  They are small, hygrophanous, lightly viscid, with a yellow-palid veil that leave remnants on the cap margin, non-striate, gills are palid to light-tan adnate to notched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spore print was brown, a kinda deeper brown, or grey-brown, a tobacco brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the spore at 1000x in KOH, these are from the top of the stipe.  The spores are marbled, lightly wrinkled.  But the important point is the germ pore, that gives the pore a slightly truncated look.  The average spore size at 11 spores is 7.5 \u0026#215; 5.0 microns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzers.  Here the cystidia are not capitate, long thin and pointed, although many somewhat blunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso some more details: the pileipellis is a cutis, with a gelatin layer, the spores are dextrinoid, no pleurocystidia observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, this all points to Galerina just fine.  Looking at the Smith and Singer monograph, the germ pore and truncated spores this points to one species pretty quickly, G. subtruncata.  There is a note that Singer thought these should be called Phaeomarasmius subtruncata.  That is a new genus on me.  In the spirit of simplicity, I\u0026#8217;m not going to go there\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese differ from the monograph in that the spores are more tobacco brown, and that these are not striate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking in Mushrooms to Genus VI, Largent and Baroni, there is also Phaeogalera, a genus created by Moser.  That genus has more tabacco brown spores with a germ pore, but also those spores are smooth and not dextrinoid.  So its not that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7/31/2008 \u0026#8211; Getting back to these.  Looking these over after looking at more Galerina and comparing to Psilocybe, these now look clearly like Psilocybe to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back through the Psilocybe monograph, there are two sections with non-blue staining temperate species, sections Psilocybe and Pratensae.  The first has species with \u0026#8220;thick\u0026#8221; walled rhomboid spores, and the second with \u0026#8220;thin\u0026#8221; walled subellipsoid spores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen looking at the spore drawings I find, I can\u0026#8217;t really tell the difference between the two\u0026#8230; or how to make sure the spore walls are 0.5-0.8 um thick, or 0.8-1.2 um thick, or something like that.  I mean they are thicker at the base, and thinner towards the pore, so where do I measure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway the ave. spore size : length \u0026#8211; 7.62 +/- 0.42 (err 0.08) um, width \u0026#8211; 4.99 +/- 0.34 (err: 0.07) \u0026#8211; q : 1.53 +/- 0.08, on 34 spores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn anycase, comparing to the micro-shots I took for P. montana, the cheilocystidia are very different.  Here they are long, and mostly acute.  Also P. montana is found with moss, and these were only on grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn grass, it looks like there is P. inqualina for the thick-walled rhomboid spores, and P. subviscida for the thin-walled subellipsoid spores.  But in the notes for these species, P. inqualina has reddish-brown-gray lamellae when young, and P. subviscida has off-white to umber dingy lamellae when young.  These have fairly light toned lamellae when young (that darken with spores as they mature).  So, I\u0026#8217;m going to go with P. subviscida here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don\u0026#8217;t know, those spores don\u0026#8217;t look that thin-walled to me\u0026#8230; I mean compared to Tubaria say\u0026#8230; I just hate the use of relative descriptives.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":22278,"consensus_name":"Deconica subviscida","location_id":41,"location_name":"Mountain View, Santa Clara Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":12011},{"id":6989,"type":"observation","date":"2008-01-20","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.80223,"created_at":"2008-03-08T20:56:28.000Z","updated_at":"2010-08-14T19:00:05.000Z","number_of_views":90,"last_viewed":"2024-01-29T08:51:52.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003e[admin \u0026#8211; Sat Aug 14 02:00:12 +0000 2010]: Changed location name from \u0026#8216;Edgewood Park, San Mateo\u0026#8217; to \u0026#8216;Edgewood Park, San Mateo, California, USA\u0026#8217;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":336,"consensus_id":565,"consensus_name":"Polyporus alveolaris","location_id":1037,"location_name":"Edgewood Park, San Mateo, San Mateo Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":12014},{"id":6990,"type":"observation","date":"2007-12-29","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.49971,"created_at":"2008-03-09T01:16:15.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T21:19:07.000Z","number_of_views":248,"last_viewed":"2024-03-15T21:11:06.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGetting back to some weird ones in the past season that I couldn\u0026#8217;t put a genus on.

At least in terms of Smith and Singer, Galerina of North America, 1964.  These stirps are similar species that are small, brown, have a clear annulus, growth on woody debris, and a light brown spore print.  The two stirps are separated by the cap cuticle, it is viscid in the G. autumnalis stirps, and not in the G. marginata stirps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are not viscid, and have a cap cutis.  This is seen in the second micro-shot.  This is of the cap surface in radial section, in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s at 400\u0026#215;.  The suface hyphae are aligned, with no gelatin matrix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spores are displayed in the third micro-shot, this is at 1000x in KOH, and the spores are from some veil tissue.  The spores have a wrinkled surface, and it cal almost be seen that they have a plage, with a rough edge.  This is easier to see comparing a few spores while adjusting the focus in and out, but hard to photograph clearly.  The spore sizes here are  9.8 \u0026#215; 5.7 microns on 23 spores measured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot here is of cheilocystidia, and this is at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.

According to Smith and Singer this fibrous zone is remnants of veil tissue, and that in young unopened buttons there should be a veil, and veil remnants on the cap margin.  This day it was raining, so there is not much evidence of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this is a galerina with clear and long pleurocystidia.

Which is just the craziest character for id, thanks to Smith and Singer.  Mostly because for most mushrooms, in most places \u0026#8211; you aren\u0026#8217;t going to see clamp connections.  But if the \u0026#8216;shroom has clamps, the place you are going to see them is in the small outer fibrous hyphae, that can grow without restriction.  In the Galerina now I\u0026#8217;ve found the place to be sure is in the fibrous hyphae coating the base of the stipe.  There in the small free hyphae, if there are clamps they will be there for every cell wall.  In these they are not there for these hyphae.  This puts these into section Tubariopsis (which makes sense I guess, since these guy look a bit like Tubaria.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to make matters worse, for these, the cell septum in the hyphae at the top of the stipe, tend to be at an angle to the hyphae growth, and at the edges of the angled septum, the cell walls tend to bulge outward.  With the cell wall at an angle, and the hyphae bulging at the ends, this can look like clamps.  But after looking at quite a few of these, in comparison to other Galerinas, it is not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, no clamps here, fine, once you decide on that, then the id falls out in the Smith and Singer monograph of Galerina, and these are G. heterocystis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the cheilocysitida on the non-fertile gill edge.

There are no pleurocystidia seen (figuring out how to not see those is another story too\u0026#8230;).  This shot is at 400x of a gill edge in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  Another nifty fact here is that the spores are non-dextrinoid, or very weakly dextrinoid when mature and in mass.  This is different than other sections of Galerina where mostly the spores are strongly dextrinoid.  This is probably a better character for this section, than lack of clamp connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the caulocystidia on the stipe apex, at 400x in KOH.
