It can be found under hornbeam trees (genus Carpinus) or more rarely under hazel (Corylus avellana) in contrast to very similar Leccinum scabrum, which grows under birches (genus Betula). For both species, there are very few exceptions known from these tight mycorrhizal relations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis find is interesting in respect to mycorrhiza. There are no Carpinus or Betula trees known as far as a few km away from this find. The closest single Corylus avellana in the vicinity grows 17 m away within the forest edge. It has poorly developed canopy, is about 4 m tall with three \u0026#8211; four trunks of 5-7 cm in diameter. It seems impossible that its root system would reach the site of the find. The forest edge near the site is composed of several large Ostrya carpinifolia (15 m away), several large Fagus sylvatica trees (22+ m away), a single Fraxinus excelsior (18 m away, trunk diameter 15 cm) and several small Picea abies. All these trees appear much too far for mycorrhiza with this find. Closer to the find are: a large Picea abies (6.5 m away, trunk diameter 60 cm), a small Frangula alnus = Rhamnus frangula (about 5 m away and 3 m tall, trunk diameter about 10 cm), a small Fraxinus ornus (also about 5 m away, 7 m tall, trunk diameter 15 cm) and a small Fagus sylvatica (about 8 m away, trunk diameter 17 cm, canopy diameter about 3 m). Picea abies is out of consideration regarding mycorrhiza. Neither Frangula alnus nor Fraxinus ornus appear in the literature (accessible to me) as possible mycorrhizal partner of Leccinellum pseudoscabrum or Leccinum scabrum. The root system of the small Fagus sylvatica apparently does not reach the spot. So, what is the mycorrhizal partner in this case remains open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother strange thing is that the ground on which the fungus was found is dry, highly water permeable, colluvial and skeletal. That is in strong opposition to fresh, moister, usually clayey ground typical for Leccinellum pseudoscabrum. Also, violet tint of blackening after bruising or cutting the mushroom, described in several sources, was not present. Bruising was directly to blackish with no other color tints. May be this determination is wrong? If so, I have no clue, what else can this find be.

It appears to be a small-sized species, probably one of the smallest sect. \u003ccite\u003eLepidella\u003c/cite\u003e in my experience.  I found another collection of it down the road \u0026#8211; about 50-75 yards away \u0026#8211; consisting of several basidiomata, and the largest one at about the same stage of development was about the same size (see \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/466844\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 466844\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe visible morphology is well documented in the attached photos.  The small size, the white woolly-felted to floccose volva breaking up into a dense network of patches on the cap surface and turning brown on the disk, the fibrous-floccose and rapidly evanescent partial veil and the densely woolly-floccose upper stipe (limbus internus?) are the salient features of this taxon. No odor was detected. \u003cbr /\u003e\n During the stipe expansion, the outer layer of tissue in the middle of the stipe cracked, giving the impression of a limbate volva.  The cross-sectional photo shows no saccate/limbate volva.\u003cbr /\u003e\nOverall fruitbody height = 7 cm; cap footprint = 4.5 cm; cap flesh = 8 mm thick above stipe; gills = 5.5 mm wide; stipe = 6.2 cm long, 1 cm wide at apex and gradually expanding to 1.2 cm just above the bulb; bulb = 2.7 cm long, 1.7 cm wide.  The spores appear high-end elongate to cylindric at x400 with no mounting agent; detailed measurements to be posted later.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1539,"consensus_id":113084,"consensus_name":"Amanita \"sp-NJ01\"","location_id":1136,"location_name":"Brendan T.

Gills 5.5 mm wide, appearing whitish to pale cream (spore print color probably B-D in Kibby Fatto), close but not crowded, not forking, with plentiful lamellulae of variable lengths.  Stipe 5 cm long and uniformly 2 cm wide, surface longitudinally textured and faintly flushed with pink here and there, not staining when handled.
