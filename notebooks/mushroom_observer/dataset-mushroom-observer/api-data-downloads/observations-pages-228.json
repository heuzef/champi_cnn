Stephenson, subsp. nov. also on DNA level. Its description fits well to the observed traits of this find. MycoBank keeps Tubulifera arachnoidea as the current name, while Index Fungorum keeps both names Tubulifera arachnoidea and Tubulifera ferruginosa as current (?).

There were at least 4 species of mushrooms present on this lot-most likely from buried tree roots. These were soft, velvety, with very fine residue on the surface. They have very small pores that seem to run down the stipe. They were in clusters but having single stipes. The surface does peel easily. Spore print was either non existent or very fine white. The edges of this mushroom did give a brown liquid during the spore printing. The largest one was at least 10 inches in width-pileus and at least 8 inches in height. The stipe on the sample I took was about 2 inches in width. I did not measure or disturb the largest one.
