Clitocybe sclerotoidea is a parasite on Helvella lacunosa. It typically attacks the mushroom just before the mushroom becomes erumpent, forming a truffle-like ball of mycelium, which it later uses to fruit from. Finding the sclerotia of C. sclerotoidea is not at all uncommon among truffle hunters.

Tuber lyoni is the newest name for T. texense and Terfezia lyoni, named originally for Lyons, France. This is the first truffle reported in the United States, found on a Mississippi River levee in the 1860\u0026#8217;s. The name has since been revised to Tuber lyoni. This is perhaps the most dispersed truffle in North and Central America. It has been reported from just north of Mexico City, Mexico in May under oak trees to Quebec, Canada under pecan trees in November/December. It is additionally reported from Georgia under pecan trees, where apparently reaches its largest size; and from American Basswood in Minnesota, where it is small but very abundant. Under the name Tuber rufum var. nitidum, it has been found under Douglas fir in Oregon. It is edible and quite good, having elements of old milk and fresh cornmeal.

I first attended a NATS forage there, and found the one truffle species I could then identify on sight: Geopora cooperi. Fuzzy peridium composed of loose felt-like hairs, with an equallly loose gleba that looks like someone tinted a loose head of lettuce, then cut it open. In other words, gleba complexly inrolled. Usually multiple gaps in the peridium leading into the gleba, as shown in these photos. Found the original collection at the NATS forage in December, 1985. Inoculated with half of the sporocarp, sent the remaining portion to NATS for identification and voucher collection. Created twig barrier around the inoculation site to keep potential animals out of site. At a subsequent forage in May, 1986 I stepped on the twigs obliterating the barrier and my only landmark to finding the site again! (OOPS!) So, with nothing to lose, I dug underneath to see if anything was actually forming. To my surprise, I found another Geopora cooperi directly beneath the twig teepee wall! Innoculation does work! In subsequent forages at Paul Bishop\u0026#8217;s (he\u0026#8217;s had over 40 forages there for mushrooms and truffles) Geopora cooperi has been found a total of 4 times, that I am aware of. The first collection was mine, in December, 1985. The second collection was also mine, in May of 1986. This led to a subsequent multiple innoculation attempts of many hypogeous and epigeous mycorrhizal fungi which at that time had never been grown, including Cantharellus formosus, Tuber gibbosum, T. oregonense, Hymenogaster parksii, Melanogaster natsii, M. tuberiformis, Barssia oregonensis and others.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":536,"consensus_id":460,"consensus_name":"Geopora cooperi","location_id":327,"location_name":"Paul Bishop's Jones Creek Tree Farm, Beavercreek, Clackamas Co., Oregon, USA","primary_image_id":18215},{"id":9844,"type":"observation","date":"2001-12-05","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.92403,"created_at":"2008-08-22T20:53:38.000Z","updated_at":"2019-05-12T04:15:38.000Z","number_of_views":33,"last_viewed":"2023-11-03T19:21:38.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMore photos of the same truffle previously shown, this time cut in half.

The Rhizopogon is a mycorrhizal species, which obtains food from a host plant, usually a tree, in exchange for gathering water and nutrients. The host plant provide the fungus with carbohydrates in exchange. This non-photosynthetic plant has tapped into the fungal network, and is living off the carbohydrates provided by the host tree. Dr.  La Rea J.

Examination by scanning electron microscopy later determined that the original collection of T. gibbosum has a pinched- or donut-shaped spore under extremely high magnification. What had been called Tuber gibbosum previously does not have that pinched-spore appearance. While spore size for both Tuber gibbosum and T. oregonense is the same, Dr. Trappe accepted the original spring T. gibbosum as the original, and renamed the new species T. oregonense. In addition, T. gibbosum in extreme maturity can have a nearly chocolate-brown gleba. Specimens which are dried can be hard to distinquish from Leucangium carthusiana, or the Oregon Black truffle.

Like Laetiporus sulphureus vs. L. coniferoides, the host species may cause profound differences in appearance, if nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":536,"consensus_id":3815,"consensus_name":"Sparassis radicata","location_id":308,"location_name":"World Forestry Center, Washington Park, Portland, Multnomah Co., Oregon, USA","primary_image_id":18510},{"id":10009,"type":"observation","date":"2002-10-20","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":false,"confidence":2.51135,"created_at":"2008-08-24T09:18:59.000Z","updated_at":"2008-08-24T09:18:59.000Z","number_of_views":37,"last_viewed":"2024-02-20T10:26:17.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eObserved at the Oregon Mycological Society\u0026#8217;s 2002 Fall Mushroom Show, Portland, Multnomah Co., OR\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":536,"consensus_id":655,"consensus_name":"Cortinarius alboviolaceus","location_id":308,"location_name":"World Forestry Center, Washington Park, Portland, Multnomah Co., Oregon, USA","primary_image_id":18512},{"id":10010,"type":"observation","date":"2005-02-25","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.51141,"created_at":"2008-08-24T09:31:47.000Z","updated_at":"2008-08-24T09:31:47.000Z","number_of_views":64,"last_viewed":"2024-04-09T19:02:53.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eThis is the very rare Melanogaster natsii, which to my knowledge has been found at only a very few locations to date.

The trees were innoculated with L.s. on the top within a month of topping the trees, and a cap of 1-2 inches was nailed over the spawn to hold it in place. Alas, there was never any fruiting of Laetiporus sulphureus. It was only later that the name Laetiporus coniferoides was coined, and I realized I had innoculated with a species inappropriate to the substrate. Nonetheless, 4 years after initial innoculation was attempted, the trees did start to fruit, but not with the species I had intended: Dacrymyces palmatus.

Some people claim that since Tuber oregonense had already been found here, that cultivation had not taken place, merely enhancement. Possible, but I think improbable. Production went from 5 pounds collected from a single 200-foot row of Douglas fir in 1986 to what I estimated as 300-1300 pounds per acre per year. That extreme variation was caused by several different species of truffles fruiting at different times of the year with the same trees. Each species was producing between 150 and 650 pounds per acre per year, and increase of 10 to 23 times what baseline data suggested. Here are some photos taken at Paul\u0026#8217;s of Tuber oregonense, mostly in situ. When people ask what I look for when truffle hunting, these are what I show them.

The spores pass through the animal without harm, and are excreted in the feces some distance away. A California Red-backed vole must eat its weight in truffles each day to stay alive. Often a complete truffle is too large for it to eat at one time, so it may leave it for another meal another time. Chris Maser has stated that a California Red-backed vole produces some 300 fecal pellets a day.

The rough ave. diameter is 6-7 um.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting this together, and looking the monograph of North American Species of Crepidotus I find that the best species name for this is Crepidotus applanatus var. globigera.  There is also Crepidotus hygrophanus which looking at the description, I can\u0026#8217;t tell them much apart\u0026#8230;  C. hygrophanus was listed as only on hardwoods, and the other on hardwoods and rarely conifers, so that suggests it is not C. hygrophanus.  Although C. hygrophanus type location was Lake Placid, and that was not so far away.  I\u0026#8217;m going to go with the one that can be on conifer wood, and is more common with a wider distribution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess these look just like Crepidotus applanatus, but differ in that the spores are larger than 6 um in diameter, where C. applanatus are about 5 um in diameter on ave.

Nevertheless, the last I heard they were still being observed in the hospital three days after ingestion.  The cook and collector was a non-English-speaking immigrant from the Punjab in India.  She collected the mushrooms near a neighbor\u0026#8217;s tennis court, where she had mushroomed without negative incident in the past.

In the west it seems that the common (sort of) Rhodocybes are R. nucliolens and R. nitellina.  In the east it seems the common Rhodocybe is R. mundula.

They are small, just at the same height at the basidia, and sparse, about every 10-20 or so basidia on the fertile gill edge.  Uncertain about on the gill face, there were too many spores there in these mature caps.
