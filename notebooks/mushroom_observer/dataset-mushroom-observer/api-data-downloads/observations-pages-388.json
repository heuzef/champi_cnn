mushrooms came from a large horse manure pile. The mushrooms grew in clumps ranging from 2 to 6. The darker color present on some caps stems from spore deposits of larger specimens. The sizes vary slightly with a range of 3-6 inches tall, with a few smaller individuals. Cap sizes range from .75-2in in diameter, again with some smaller individuals present. Specimens range in color from light tan to dark brown with stems that are whiteish tan near the cap, and darken to deep brown near the base. Each specimens stem has vertical lines that run the entire length.  The stems are hollow and fibrous. Spore prints are jet black. I am very much an amateur so I’m sorry if my notes aren’t good. One thing that throws me off is the dry peeling appearance of some of the caps, I have seen this before on past fruitings in the same manure pile and it throws me off each
