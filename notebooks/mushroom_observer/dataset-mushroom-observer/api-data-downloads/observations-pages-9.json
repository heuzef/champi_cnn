When a Rhizopogon is found in sandy conditions, such as sand dunes along the Oregon Coast in association with Lodgepole pine, and has yellowish or off-yellowish rhizomorphs (thread-like mycelial cords)covering the peridium, it is almost assuredly Rhizopogon occidentalis, aka Western Rhizopogon. This is an edible species, and favored by many native animals (and some people). Dr. James Trappe has suggested drying sliced Rhizopogon spinkled lightly with salt, and eating like potato chips with your favorite dip. Sporocarps of this species often must have the sand brushed from it before eating. The gleba can be nearly white when very young, quickly (within a day) turning to yellowish-white, then grayish white and finally a rather dark gray-green color. It can also have a distinctive odor, similar to bananas, when approaching peak maturity. Photos show the collection in situ first, then after excavation.

The Japanese name literally means Pine (matsu-) and Mushroom (take, taki). The odor is distinctive, reminding me of cinnamon red-hots and sweat (some people say dirty socks, which I would interpret as the same thing). This particular bed was one of the larger collections of matsutake I have taken from a single location. About 1/3 of the mushrooms were, in my opinion, too small to harvest. I suspect others found them later, since they were gone a week later. When first found this bed of matsutake showed only a single mushroom above ground hiding under salal. It likes sandy or well-drained locations. I have found it at  3200 feet elevation in the Cascades Mountains near Little Crater Lake, Clackamas Co., OR; along the Pacific Ocean in sand dunes near Tillamook, Tillamook Co., OR; and associated with very old-growth Douglas fir in the Timothy Lake area, Clackamas County, Oregon.

This is among the most common Macowanites species found in the United States, although most people don\u0026#8217;t recognize it. It most frequently looks like a tiny button mushroom barely erumpent from a gravel pathway or on the sides of roads or in sandy areas; rarely in humus. This particular species can be identified in part by its aroma: sweet with a hint of metallic aftertaste in the back of the throat. Most often associated with Sitka spruce in my experience. Stipe is tiny and centralized. Gills are complex and grown together in cross-section, very similar in appearance to Martellia vesiculosa, which is frequently found nearby. Martellia has a yellowish gleba with a basal tuft of sterile tissue; Macowanites always has a rudimentary stem. I have been collecting this species at the same location for the past 20 years. It is an old friend, even though this photo would not be descriptive to anyone else I\u0026#8217;m afraid. I have often seen ground squirrels, chipmunks, and squirrels either eating on larger specimens, or caching them for later consumption. The aroma is attractive to me, and I am tempted to sample it myself. Macowanites is related to Russula mushrooms. In this photo, an animal has just sampled the tiny mushroom/truffle, exposing the gleba. There is some question among truffle experts whether this is a mushroom becoming a truffle, or a truffle becoming a mushroom.

Pisquah Show, but I believe this collection was brought in by Adrian Beyerle, whose truffle collecting is legendary among the North American Truffling Society. According to the field guide the difference between H. crassirhachis and H. separable is microscopic and therefore cannot be determined in the field. Nonetheless, H. crassirhachis tends to be found in solitary conditions; H. separable tends to be found in great mats where several hundred sporocarps may be uncovered in a single square foot. Both species become culinarily interesting (to me) only in extreme age. Very mature Hysterangium have an aroma similar to overripe olives, and a similar soft texture. The gelatinous interior of less mature truffles. This truffle is extremely important to steep slopes, since the widespread mat communities help hold soil in place, as well as rocks, twigs, and other surface debris.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":536,"consensus_id":2646,"consensus_name":"Hysterangium crassirhachis","location_id":305,"location_name":"Mount Pisgah Arboretum, Lane Co., Oregon, USA","primary_image_id":17319},{"id":9270,"type":"observation","date":"2005-10-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":false,"confidence":2.47555,"created_at":"2008-08-15T18:27:13.000Z","updated_at":"2008-08-15T18:27:13.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2024-02-07T20:12:24.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eObserved at the Mt.
