Depending on the author they are treated on species, subspecies or variety level or both considered as a single species. The main distinguishing traits would be habitat (broadleaf versus conifers forest) and spore width (C. hercynicus has broader spores). Measured spore width in this observation is somewhere in between both options, somewhat inclined toward C. hercynicus. In addition, the mushrooms were growing in a pure Picea abies stand in alpine phytogeographical region, which also speaks in favor of C. hercynicus. Two writings of subspecies name are in use \u0026#8211; hercynicus and harcynicus, the second one being correct (Ref.:(1)).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing in large groups, certainly more than 50 pilei present in a relatively small area around about ten, fifteen large Picea abies trees.

However, Exidia pithya is supposed to be an \u0026#8216;easy\u0026#8217; case. Substratum (exclusively conifers), almost complete lack of glandular warts, small overall size and relatively thin fruit bodies should reliably distinguish it from other black species of this genus. Young fruit bodies are often distinctly radially wrinkled (Ref.: (4)). Microscopic traits are very variable in this genus and hence of little discriminatory power. A surprise of this observation seems to be the substratum. Namely, Ref. : (5) states for it only conifers in bark, while my observation grows directly on wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing in groups of several fruit bodies, many coalescing.

To add to my excitement as I was quietly preparing to take some images, when a \u0026#8220;platypus\u0026#8221; trundled past me on the surface, oblivious of my presence. (I clicked off some shots, but camera settings were set for macro, so proof of the incident although detectable , not loadable, but a record of some value.) \u003cbr /\u003e\n   The fungi was coloured from soft white in some small areas, to light orange, dark orange, and almost fire engine red on some tips. Getting wet was well worth it. The largest specimen was about 3cm in length and about 25mm in height. All growths were in excellent condition. The log which would normally be under water, was soaked, and would have provided the moisture for the fungi to survive the heat. The humidity was 95%.  I have loaded images of all stages of growth.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe texture was rubbery and not easily damaged. I have not had time to scope this specimen as yet, but will add the micrographs sometime over the weekend.\u003cbr /\u003e\nBecause of the poor light, fill flash was used and some images have been colour adjusted, but remain true to what was seen when fresh.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAnother one of Australias\u0026#8217; nature surprises. I favour Craterellus from the description but micrographs obviously will help. (soon)\u003cbr /\u003e\nI have not seen a specimen keep its colour as well for the time I have had it at home. (48hrs) I will load the home collected specimen to show the colour still remaining. Really surprising.(for me at least.)\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":410,"consensus_id":6228,"consensus_name":"Guepinia","location_id":262,"location_name":"Swans Crossing State Forest, New South Wales, Australia","primary_image_id":406444},{"id":160527,"type":"observation","date":"2014-02-26","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.76139,"created_at":"2014-02-28T03:31:59.000Z","updated_at":"2014-02-28T22:41:07.000Z","number_of_views":17,"last_viewed":"2023-10-21T00:43:05.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003ePlease analyze images for mixed collection (e.g. a fungi growing on another fungi).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFound on the Pacific shoreline on decaying drift wood washed upon the beach.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":3525,"consensus_id":63,"consensus_name":"Schizophyllum commune","location_id":251,"location_name":"Washington, USA","primary_image_id":406435},{"id":160528,"type":"observation","date":"2014-02-26","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.6863,"created_at":"2014-02-28T03:36:25.000Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T22:16:20.000Z","number_of_views":23,"last_viewed":"2023-10-23T11:39:31.000Z","owner_id":3525,"consensus_id":443,"consensus_name":"Multiclavula mucida","location_id":251,"location_name":"Washington, USA","primary_image_id":406448},{"id":160529,"type":"observation","date":"2014-02-26","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.841367,"created_at":"2014-02-28T03:39:08.000Z","updated_at":"2014-02-28T20:41:17.000Z","number_of_views":16,"last_viewed":"2023-12-23T14:42:50.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound on the Pacific shoreline on decaying drift wood washed upon the beach.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":3525,"consensus_id":557,"consensus_name":"Dacrymyces chrysospermus","location_id":251,"location_name":"Washington, USA","primary_image_id":406456},{"id":160530,"type":"observation","date":"2014-02-26","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.840543,"created_at":"2014-02-28T03:44:51.000Z","updated_at":"2015-04-18T00:57:20.000Z","number_of_views":34,"last_viewed":"2024-01-01T01:07:29.000Z","owner_id":3525,"consensus_id":40536,"consensus_name":"Fomitopsis ochracea","location_id":251,"location_name":"Washington, USA","primary_image_id":406463},{"id":160531,"type":"observation","date":"2014-02-26","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.51043,"created_at":"2014-02-28T03:45:16.000Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T10:32:55.000Z","number_of_views":63,"last_viewed":"2023-12-29T09:21:50.000Z","owner_id":3525,"consensus_id":46490,"consensus_name":"Ganoderma subg.

Quoting the above mentioned authors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;the three species cannot be distinguished based on ascospore sizes, or ascus-related morphological traits, characters that are commonly used to identify many lichen-forming fungi (Schumm 2003). Second, characteristically developed specimens can hardly be found for L. macaronesica and L. pulmonaria in some localities (S. Werth, personal observation). Third, whereas characteristically developed adult L. macaronesica can be distinguished from L. pulmonaria by its slightly different vegetative propagules, reliable identifications are highly problematic as characters largely overlap among species. Fourth, young specimens of L. immixta may not show any schizidia, and are therefore impossible to distinguish from the other two species, unless chemical data are taken into consideration. However, despite the difficulty of morphological identifications of these three species, they are genetically distinct.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs probably all know Macaronesia is a zone constituted by four archipelagos: Azores (Portugal), Madeira Islands (Portugal), including the Desertas Islands, Porto Santo Island, and the Selvagens Islands, Canary Islands  (Spain), Cape Verde Islands (Cape Verde) and the coastal part of the Northwest of Africa, extending from Marocco to Senegal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first reference below it is mentioned that among the specimens used for identification of the three species, in the case of \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Lobaria+macaronesica\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eL. macaronesica\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e there is one from (continental) Portugal (from Sintra).

I dug into the crusted burned surface and found a very dry, brittle, and bright orange substrate which I suspected to be fungal. So when I was processing another pile about a week later, it was no surprise to see patches of this obviously fungal surface. I photographed it, sent it to an expert for identification, and he indicated that this was the first observation of this species in Santa Cruz County.
