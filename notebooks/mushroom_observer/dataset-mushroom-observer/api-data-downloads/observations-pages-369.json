Margin of cap very thick and either inrolled or nearly so, darker than the caps and usually showing signs of rot. Gills, when present, off-white, with many subgills. Some older patches discolored. Stipes whiter near apex, solid and tough, and with tapered bases, which were much darker in color and beginning to rot. No partial veil, eliminating N. lepideus.

mature specimen was collected about 30m from a small pond at Pauraque Ridge Farm in northern Bee, Co., Texas.  It was near a location where several examples of an Agaricus species were collected earlier this year (see MO402412).  Although this is probably the same species, what caught my attention was the highly convex cap of this one in contrast to the mostly flat caps of the mature specimens I had collected previously. This variance could be caused by different sunlight intensity (being later in the spring) or different moisture conditions, or maybe something else.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt was solitary (accept that a younger cap was growing from the same position on the ground).  It has dark brown gills and was of an ivory color, both pileus, and stipe.  The gills were free.  The cap was mostly smooth, but tiny hairs could be seen with a hand lens.  The margin of the cap was curled under and more or less smooth.  The larger cap margin was not quite a circle measuring 4.6cm long and 4.2cm wide.  The stipe (5.5cm long) tapered from 1.3cm where it connected with the cap at 0.8cm to the ground.  I did not detect color changes with bruising. An obvious ring was on the stipe but no sign of a volva.  Latex was absent.  The odor was distinctly like A. bisporus.  The stim was cut and observed to be “stuffed.”  I noticed a slight yellowing on the inside surface of the cut stipe.  Very slight color changes were noticed after the application of 4% KOH (faint yellowing), NH4OH (faint yellowing), and FeSo4 (slightly greenish).\u003c/p\u003e","Micro":"\u003cp\u003eI collected spores from the larger cap, prepared a slide stained with KOH, and measured the approximate length and width of 30 examples.  The average spore length was 6.89µm (σ 0.42µm) and the average width was 4.93µm (σ 0.27µm).\u003cbr /\u003e\nOkay, call me an overbearing nerd, but I decided to include a link to a video (\u003ca href=\"http://reflectionstexas.com/Spore%20measurement/\"\u003ehttp://reflectionstexas.com/Spore%20measurement/\u003c/a\u003e) of how I am making the spore measurements.  I have an inexpensive microscope with a camera port (Amscope ~ $300).  Most of the time, I go to the trouble of using the oil emersion lens (1000x) and making the measurements at that magnification.  This time, I used 400x and no oil.  I have an old Canon Rebel T2i and use a free program called DigiCamControl to take photos with the Rebel and transfer them to my desktop.  I have an etched slide ($12) that allowed me to calibrate my system at both 400x and 1000\u0026#215;.  I then use Adobe Photoshop to crop down to a  single spore, rotate it horizontally, and measure the number of pixels in length and width.  At 400x, 19.28 pixels equal 1.0µm and at 1000x, 48.78 pixels equal 1.0µm.  For example, if a length of one spore is 145 pixels (131 pixels/19.28 pixels/µm = 6.791µm).\u003cbr /\u003e\nTo nerd it a bit more, I am including a graph of the length vs width of the spore measurement for this example.\u003cbr /\u003e\nNote: I had to generate the video at a low resolution to upload it easily.

stinkhorn was spotted in our yard near Normanna, Texas yesterday as an “egg-shaped” growth after about an inch of recent slow rain.  Overnight, it popped up as a fly-attracting stinkhorn and I collected it today.  The top structure is a rough funnel shape with a hole leading to a hollow stipe.  From the bottom of the funnel and wrapped around the top of the stipe, is a gooey, stinky, dark brown collar.  The stipe is 15cm long and 2cm in diameter arising from a vulva half-buried in the soil. A remnant veil is attached 3cm above the top of the vulva.  The stipe is a spongy off-white hollow structure.
