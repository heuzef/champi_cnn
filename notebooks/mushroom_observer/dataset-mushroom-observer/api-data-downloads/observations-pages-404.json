This does not bring to my mind any species of Amanita, although the material is old and perhaps the macro-traits are eroded/deformed due to occasionally subfreezing temperatures. In past years I have seen specimens representing the A. lavendula group very late in the season. Maybe the basal bulb had rotted in-situ? Nothing else comes to mind, except perhaps Mycena.
