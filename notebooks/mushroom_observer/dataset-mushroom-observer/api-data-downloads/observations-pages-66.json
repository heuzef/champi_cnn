specimens were found growing out of a layer of woodchips on top of dirt, on a rainy night, in an area surrounded by pine trees. They were out in the open, with nothing to shade them from the sun.  Most were in fairly loose, small gregarious clusters. Not in ring formation. I did not notice a strong smell from them, and I can’t tell you what they taste like, because I don’t know if they’re safe, and so am unwilling to try them. Some of them appeared to be dead. These were sometimes laying on their side. These ones no longer exhibited the typical umbrella shaped caps. The top outer side of the caps had curled up into a convex shape, with frayed edges. And the color of the mushrooms had turned gray. I could be wrong about that. I was looking at them at night with a flashlight, plus I’ve learned that I am, unfortunately, somewhat color-blind. People say that money is green, but U.S. paper notes have always looked gray to me. The stems were hollow. The cap of the largest one had a diameter of about 4 and a half inches, and the cavity ran about half way down the stem. The smallest one that I took apart just had a small dimple in the middle of the stem, were it connects to the cap. I squooshed, and cut certain parts of the stems and caps of these mushrooms, and then looked at the injuries about 24 hours later. They had turned a little darker and looked wetter, but did not change color.  I gently tore apart one of the caps, and did not find that it has a pellicle. I collected spore prints of them on tinfoil. To my eyes, the prints that were lighter had the same color and shad as pencil graphite.

There was this big cluster. they seemed almost a little rubbery. the caps looked a lot like gilled boletes I have been finding, and the young ones had the same brilliant yellow gills. The gills appeared to stop at the stipe, they were not decurrent. At least one older specimen (as seen in the photo on the right) had differently colored gills which seem to have changed with age. The weird clustering, lack of decurrent gills, and strange gill color of the older specimens seem to suggest that it is NOT P. rhodoxanthus, but if I were handed a young individual that it what I would probably call it, and that was definitely my first thought upon finding them. I brought two specimens to Christain Schwarz, and he proposed that they could even be highly deformed sulfer tufts, due to the bright gill color, and changing gill color of older individuals.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1926,"consensus_id":216,"consensus_name":"Hypholoma fasciculare","location_id":72,"location_name":"University of California Santa Cruz (UC Santa Cruz) (UCSC), Santa Cruz Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":182443},{"id":82564,"type":"observation","date":"2011-11-02","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.52152,"created_at":"2011-11-15T08:17:42.000Z","updated_at":"2011-11-15T21:19:47.000Z","number_of_views":52,"last_viewed":"2023-09-25T11:29:43.000Z","owner_id":2278,"consensus_id":421,"consensus_name":"Laetiporus gilbertsonii","location_id":811,"location_name":"Freedom Blvd., Aptos, Santa Cruz Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":182444},{"id":82565,"type":"observation","date":"2011-11-14","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.52148,"created_at":"2011-11-15T08:21:51.000Z","updated_at":"2011-11-15T08:27:41.000Z","number_of_views":28,"last_viewed":"2023-08-03T17:34:44.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound under douglas fir about 50m up chinquapin rd from the first water tanks.
