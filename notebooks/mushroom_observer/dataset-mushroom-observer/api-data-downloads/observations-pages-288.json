Thus, this mushroom fruited last night or early this morning. Mature specimen found just after 11 AM today. This one has a rather pale cap surface, although not quite as pale as the photo implies (viewed first-hand a bit more gray). I managed to catch a glimpse of it just before the lawn mower spotted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotable traits include, silvery gray to gray cap often with particles of soil on the surface,  fragile membranous basal volva buried in the soil, occurrence in an open grassy area, stipe surface with small white floccose deposits that are easily rubbed off. The basal volva is typically difficult to remove intact from the substrate. The whitish \u0026#8220;plate\u0026#8221; seen next to the mushroom (3rd photo down) is part of the volval remnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShort gill ends truncate to concave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two different spots on my property where I find this type mushroom. Each spot features mature shagbark hickory. In the case of the mushroom seen here, there is little doubt about the symbiont being the large hickory tree. The only other tree close enough to qualify is a red maple that we planted. On this part of the lawn, including a south-facing slope, I have seen hundreds of examples of this taxon over the 17+ summers I have lived here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExact location, 239 Golf Course Road, Hunlock Creek, PA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScoped spores in several different areas of a print. Length, width, and quotient (Q), were all fairly variable. The majority of the spores seen were ellipsoid. But some were broadly ellipsoid, a few were subglobose, and a very few were elongate (the latter possibly due to partially collapsed lateral spore wall). A few spores appeared with globose profile, although in at least some cases this may be due to a head-on alignment of the spore. But a few rather large ones appeared globose. For the most part, range of dimensions was 9-12 \u0026#215; 7-9, but one really long spore had length ~14 and a few rather short ones had (perceived) lengths ~8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding spore dimensions for this taxon, over the years I have observed considerable variation\u0026#8230; to the point where I wonder if here may be a cryptic species (or maybe a large-spored variety of rooseveltensis) present in the same area.

The difference is that minutula is described as lacking partial veil, whereas pv is listed as being present with sp-34. I believe this observation may shed light upon this issue. Photos seen here and labeled \u0026#8220;B\u0026#8221; show a tiny button of the taxon observed (found maybe 2 feet away from the others which are labeled \u0026#8220;A\u0026#8221;). This button is seen to have a thin fuzzy layer mainly covering the unexpanded gills, but also clinging to the upper stipe. The visual effect is that of a somewhat cortinate partial veil.

Same exact location as the type specimen. I have observed a number of other fruit bodies in this same 4 square yard area that likely represent the same taxon. But, not many of them manage to remain in-situ until maturity, due to this material apparently being a favorite food for slugs. The recent spell of dry weather probably helped this critter (although some slug damage is apparent). This mushroom fruited during dry weather. Only \u0026lt;0.01 inch rainfall during the 3.5 days leading up to my finding it. Not more than 30 hours previous to this discovery, I had carefully checked the location and this mushroom was not present at that time. Other fruit bodies observed in this location over the past 3 years (possibly representing the same taxon) have featured unexpanded caps. In most of these cases, the umbo is prominent, but gray instead of brown (except for the type specimen).
