thought \u0026#8220;Lanmaoa psuedosensibilis\u0026#8221;, based upon the amount of blue staining and the lack of any bouillon odor. However, as pointed out by IG Safonov (as seen in 525808) neither the cap color nor the stipe color point toward pseudosensibilis. So, Baorangia bicolor then appeared as the best proposal. Looking back at my photos of this bolete, I see a few that were taken several hours after it was collected. A scratch on the pores had become brown (a Lanmaoa trait). Also, the dark staining on the context of the sectioned stipe seems more appropriate for Lanmaoa than Baorangia. Several L. pallidoroseus collections were made during this weekend foray, and (with the possible exception of this one) they all had the prominent bouillon odor.

The name Russula means red or reddish. This is because many of the huge number of species in this genus have red cups. It is typical for this species to show a mixture of yellow, orange and red tints. It is a mild-tasting and edible mushroom, but it is unusual to find them in a sufficient number to justify collecting. It grows mainly under hardwood trees, particularly under beech (Fagus sylvatica), but also under conifers (Ref.3).
