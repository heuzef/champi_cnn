And at the time I thought they were, and first pass under the scope I thought they were.

But they are not\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the cheilocystidia on the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The cystidia look a bit like Galerina cystidia, with half of them capitate.  But half of them are not, they are straight and acute.  And it is weird to be half and half.  Also adding to this, the spores are non-dextrinoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the cap cuticle, which is a thick ixocutis, of hyphae interwoven in a gelatin matrix.

The spores are ellipsoid, non-pointed and smooth.  No exosporal covering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe macroscopic all looks good for Galerina, except with a thicker stipe and viscid they should have a fiberous annulus, and they don\u0026#8217;t, but there are a few that don\u0026#8217;t listed in the monograph.  The capitate cystidia looks good for Galerina, but the spores give it away.  A Galerina that looks like this would have dextrinoid spores, pointed, and roughened.  Since these are non-dextrinoid, ellipsoid and smooth, this is a Pholiota.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking in the Hessler and Smith monograph of Pholiota, on page 87, there is P. aurantioflava.  Which in the comments they say looks to be a species that intergrades with Galerina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting to Pholiota I notice that the gills are rather yellow-brown, and too yellow to really be Galerina, which should have tipped off Pholiota from the start, with the viscid cap and yellowish gills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh live and learn\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":5612,"consensus_name":"Pholiota aurantioflava","location_id":8,"location_name":"Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":12512},{"id":7234,"type":"observation","date":"2007-12-29","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.32347,"created_at":"2008-04-03T23:42:02.000Z","updated_at":"2008-07-13T03:43:57.000Z","number_of_views":240,"last_viewed":"2024-02-24T00:31:44.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eTwo really little guys, given to me in the hopes they might be Galerina, but pretty quickly, could see they are not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of the pileipellis in radial section (that curled around after cut and mounteded), at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The cap surface here is clearly hymeniform, and not a cutis.  So this along makes it a Conocybe instead of a Galerina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The cystidia here are capitate, with fat rounded bottoms (is it ok to say that?).  The capitate cystidia make this a Conocybe and not a Pholiotina (it case you want to split off Pholiotina as a genus).  Which matches since the stipe does not have an annulus, and I believe Pholiotinas have a small membranous annulus.  Like Conocybe filaris is really a Pholiotina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I was thinking at some point I would try to get these to species, but I\u0026#8217;m not sure that is going to happen anytime soon, so I thought I would just pops these up here for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7/12/2008 \u0026#8211; Getting back to these, not sure why I was going through some stuff orgaqnizing, and this one caught my eye.

The third micro-shot here is of some caulocystidia from the apex of the stipe at 400x in KOH.

This might be a fairly good match, the spore size gets you to a set of Conocybe (along with having no veil), and it seems that the other Conocybe will have fibrous hyphae on the stipe, or caulocystidia of different shape intermixed with cystidia similar to the cheilocystidia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I\u0026#8217;m going to go with this one.

But in terms of Smith and Singer, it is an unknown species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took this one off the id table in the red barn there, so I don\u0026#8217;t know where they came from or the habitat.

Mostly they are brown and Galerina like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of a gill edge at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.

But the intersting thing here, is that the surface hyphae are not radially aligned.  The hyphae are in a single sruface layer, but in this layer they are interwoven.  This is a feature I haven\u0026#8217;t seen in other Galerinas where surface hyphae tend to be mostly radially aligned, with little random wander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000\u0026#215;.

But she had to have a name, this kid had to finish his project, and a name had to be in the id box.

The first micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The surface is a layer of single upright inflated cells, or hymeniform, so not a Galerina, which would be a cutis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shote is of the gill edge at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.

I haven\u0026#8217;t really seen cystidia like these before.  Also you can see that the spores are brown and non-dextrinoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of a spore at 1000x from the stipe apex in KOH, and here you can see the spore is ellipsoid, non-pointed, smooth and with a germ pore.  (Also brown in KOH.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, not a Galerina, but actually a Pholiotina.  Or Conocybe if you like.  I\u0026#8217;m usually all for simplifying things, and trying to put a stop to this ever exploding list of genera, but I have to say, I\u0026#8217;ve embrased the Conocybe/Pholiotina split.  After looking at a few of each, and photos from when they are fresh, there is a clear differences, and there are more than one species in each here.  So, if thin, cone-shaped caps with thin gills and no veil = Conocybe.  With a thicker cap (sort-of), thicker gills, and a veil = Pholiotina.  Also the difference is in the cystidia, capitate = Conocybe, and non-capitate = Pholiotina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and now how to tell the difference between Pholiotina and Galerina: membranous veil (small) in the middle of the stipe = Pholiotina, fibrous zoned veil near the top of the stipe (just below the cap edge) = Galerina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5/25/2008 \u0026#8211; Actually getting back to this one\u0026#8230;  Looking through Flora Agaracina Neerlandica Vol. 6, at the Pholiotina section, there are two species here with a veil, large spores and flat, wide cheilocystidia (utriform).  They are split by one has 2-spored basidia, and the other 4-spored.  Looking at the photos I took at the time, one has the attached spored in groups of 2.

Not a question that they don\u0026#8217;t match anything, but that they match too many things in the Smith and Singer monograph, and I was going to wait until I has seen enough similar but different do start to tell which is what.  But in the end everything I see similar, is just exactly like these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI some private conversations with Prof. Gro Gulden he has taken a view to simplify the genus Galerina, and in that picture these best match G. sahleri from the Smith and Singer monograph.  He has equated this to another name, but I don\u0026#8217;t have the details on how and why there yet, so I\u0026#8217;ve decide to site these obs. as the published Smith and Singer taxon for now, until a future publication will move that to a new name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, anyway, here they are, some G. sahleri from the Pt. Reyes Mycoblitz.  These were found on moss on a live D. Fir tree, the others I\u0026#8217;ve seen were on moss on dead D. Fir logs.  These seem to be a Galerina species that like the moss on log habitat (compared to moss in grass habitat, or log with no moss habitat\u0026#8230;).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first photo here is of the guys, they are small, thin, not much going on.  The tallest one there is ~2.5-3 cm long, most of these are 1-2 cm in length, the stipe width (much) less than a mm wide, and the cap only 3-8 mm wide.

There weren\u0026#8217;t any pleurocystidia obs., but in some places this was uncertain.  Some of the gills were beatup and chewed on, and S \u0026amp; S mention that this can encourge the growth of some new cystidia, so that was uncertain.  But on a few (3-4) gills is was clear there were no pleurocystidia obs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of some basidia and spores attached from the inside cap surface at 400x in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s.  The spores are clearly dextrinoid, and I add this shot because you can see at a few place that the spores are attached in clumps of 4.  So, this species has 4-spored basidia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth micro-shot is of the spores from the stipe apex in KOH at 1000\u0026#215;.

In many the exosporal covering also blisters at the apex, giving them also a \u0026#8220;hood\u0026#8221; with their skirt.  This puts these into the section Calyptrata, and the thin, short stipes best fits G. sahleri.

Smith and Singer called these calyptrate spores, and put species with these into the section Calyptrata.

BEHOLD, a singular and similar NEW specimen in a more advanced stage of maturity was found. I am quite certain that this is the same species as the original ones from about 12 months ago. The physical shape has not changed greatly.\u003cbr /\u003e\nI have taken extra images in as many aspects as was possible and there are some distinguishing effects that may help in the identification. (All images were taken with natural light on long exposures.) These effects are reasonably clear in the images. \u003cbr /\u003e\nThe speciman was not removed or touched in the hope that I can get back and observe if the cap has opened. The position of this new fungi is in the identical crevice, where the original ones were found. I would say that the new specimen was approximately 3.5 cm in length. I did notice also in one of the images that there appears to be some hairy growth on the stem that has broken away from the stem. The texture break on the stem below the cap did not extend the full circle of the stem as can be seen from some of the images taken from the opposite side. (I am not sure why this has occured.)\u003cbr /\u003e\n The original stems were white and the tops stawberry red. The more mature (new) specimen displays what I would accept as happening in a more mature specimen. The tree trunk is dead, and is of the euclyptus family, and stands about 20feet tall. The centre has burnt out to some degree which is fairly common in this species. From the growing shape now prevailing, I think that Tom Volk is probably close in saying that it could be a Boletus.\u003cbr /\u003e\n*******************************************************************************\u003cbr /\u003e\n02/01/2009\u003cbr /\u003e\nFinal images and additional notes.\u003cbr /\u003e\nObservation 34119\u0026#8230;to 34125 inclusive.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis was what I was presented with on arrival at the site of the specimen I have\u003cbr /\u003e\n been obseving. Unfortunately the time between the last group of images and these images was longer than I had hoped. The Cap was fully grown and sadly the specimen had begun to deteriorate. I have salvaged as much information as was possible. I must admit I was dissapointed in seeing this specimen in its final stage of life. (access to this area is difficult.)\u003cbr /\u003e\nOVERVIEW\u0026#8230;..\u003cbr /\u003e\nBefore removing the fungi, I took several shots to show the natural habitat and the state of the fungi.\u003cbr /\u003e\n The base of the stem appeared to be wedged securely in the crevase of the trunk. When removed, the underside of the cap was on one side severely effected by age.\u003cbr /\u003e\n At this point I decided that a spore count would not be creditable and so none was taken.\u003cbr /\u003e\n The stem at the base was as can be seen, to be wedge shaped. The texture was dry and woody. I have also bisected the complete specimen and it can be seen that the pink is still showing in some areas. There also appears to be some dicolouration in the stem near the cap, \u0026amp; I am not sure if this was natural, or caused by bruising during bisection. \u003cbr /\u003e\nThe cap has easily discernable protrudences.\u003cbr /\u003e\nI also broke a small section of the stem off at the base of the stem. \u003cbr /\u003e\nIt clearly shows the pink colouring at the outer edges of the stem. Apart from the deteriorating mushroom odour, there has not been any identificable aroma from the specimen each time I checked it . (1st, 2nd \u0026amp; 3rd obs group.) I did not keep the specimen.  I do have some small doubts as to whether the original specimen (which has been sent to America for DNA testing) is the same as the second specimen that has been recorded in the same location on the tree trunk.\u003cbr /\u003e\nOnly the DNA will prove this is hope.

All but the coccora have a bulbous base with a tight vulva. The coccora has a yellow cap with a large patch of white veil material which peals off easily revealing the whole cap to be cream to bright yellow. Some specimens are paler than others, and a small, pale specimen would resemble an ocreata, but the veil material and the vulva are distinctive on the coccora. When the mushrooms have fruited out for a couple of days the identification becomes more difficult. The angels discolr slightly and the coccoras fade to a tan color with the veil patch on the cap resembling white paint. When the coccoras are fresh, the veil patch is thick and spongy. Fresh spring coccoras have no discernable odor or taste raw. After a couple of days they have a sort of fishy odor. The destroying angels are pure white inside and out when fresh. If you cannot recognize these differences the mushroom MUST be discarded.

One of these was a grey fleshy hygrophorus, and there was a discussion about it being either H. marzuolus or H. camarophyllus.  I had seen grey guys id\u0026#8217;ed from the Yuba pass area in the spring before, and the difference I was told in the id at the time was that H. marzuolus smells like mouse cages, and H. camarophyllus is only fungal smelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimi went on to point out that H. marzuolus is a European species really, rare in the US, and the lit. from Europe doesn\u0026#8217;t mention the mouse cage odor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, as a weird guy, I thought I would just add some micro-details and create at least one \u0026#8220;good\u0026#8221; observation of this thing, to build on here.  Herman went back up the hill, and got another one, and dried it and sent it to me, and I put it under the scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u0026#8216;shroom is shown in the first two shots, by Herman Brown.  It is grey, fleshy, whitish to off-white stipe and gills.  The cap is kinda viscid, and he tells me there was no odor of mouse cage, only a shroomy odor.  Dried it didn\u0026#8217;t smell like anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of a gill section in Congo Red at 100\u0026#215;.  This displays the divergent gill trama which is particular to many species of the Hygrophorus section of the genus Hygrophorus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the basidia attached to the gill trama at 400x in Congo Red.  Here the basidia are shown to be long and thin, along with the divergent trama, this is def. now a Hygrophorus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of the cap surface in radial section at 400x in water.  The pileipellis is an ixocutis, with radially aligned hyphae in a gelatin layer.  This is a fairly thin layer, on a hypodermium of interwoven hyphae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth micro-shot is of the basidia with some spores attached at 1000x in congo red.  Here this shows a 4-spored basidia, with spores attached to long sterigmata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, now what to do with this.  Using three sources, (1) \u0026#8220;Spring Mushrooms of the Sierras\u0026#8221; D. Desjardin, (2) \u0026#8220;Hygrophorus of CA\u0026#8221; D. Largent, and (3) \u0026#8220;N. American Hygrophorus\u0026#8221; L. R. Hessler and A. H. Smith, I get \u0026#8211; nowhere\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at features, noting the sources:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo mousy odor (1): H. camarophyllus\u003cbr /\u003e\nViscid cap (1,2,3): H. marzuolus\u003cbr /\u003e\nHypodermium of interwoven \u0026#8220;puzzle-like\u0026#8221; hyphae (2): H. camarophyllus\u003cbr /\u003e\nLong sterigmata (2): H. marzuolus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLargent actually goes on to say that H. camarophyllus lacks any sterigmata (I\u0026#8217;m not sure how a basidia produces spores without this, but I can\u0026#8217;t find another species of Hygrophorus that I have a sample of, with the same claim, I was hoping to compare.).  Hessler and Smith state that the hypodermium is of radial aligned hyphae, not the \u0026#8220;puzzle-like\u0026#8221; hyphae that Largent notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing, is that the whole thing between these species comes from very few samples.  Largent bases the whole thing on one each, and A. H. Smith kinda started with whole thing, by finding one in a snow bank in Idaho, and calling that one H. marzuolus, and its gone on from there.  H. camarophyllus seems to be a fairly common grey guy from the east, but uncertain how rare from here.  Largent makes a note of the odor, and that note I believe has been used over the years for the Spring fungi class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, there it is, one found, and here are some observations, and toss a coin, it is 50-50 from features, one or the other.  To keep going, it would be good to get someone to observe and post some H. camarophyllus from back east.  And anyone that want to add some European sources to compare to this observation feel free.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":677,"consensus_name":"Hygrophorus","location_id":254,"location_name":"Greenville, California, USA","primary_image_id":13424},{"id":7555,"type":"observation","date":"2008-05-19","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.47959,"created_at":"2008-05-19T20:52:47.000Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T13:36:47.000Z","number_of_views":46,"last_viewed":"2024-02-08T14:31:09.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound in an open, mulched (straw) area surrounded by Live Oak.

Cheilocystidia observed, long filamentous, numerous, some branched.  Pleurocystidia not observed except for some near the gill edge.  Mostly 4-spored basidia with some 3-spored.  Spores thick walled, ellipsoid, inamyloid, non-dextrinoid and lightly warted.  Clamp connections observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the NA monograph on Crepidotis by Hessler and Smith, this gets you down close to C. fibriatus, which is what is often seen at the Spring Fungi of Sierras course, and was id\u0026#8217;ed as such in the past years.  But it is also close to C. pallidoluteus, and in the comments for C. fibriatus it says that C. pallidoluteus is similar but the pileus is more yellow and the margin is non-fibrate.  It also mentions that the margin is inrolled in C. fibriatus in not in C. pallidoluteus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Desjardin commented that these look to be a different species than C. fibriatus, and with the details and comments in the monograph, it does look like these are a better match for C. pallidoluteus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monograph mentions that this species was observed in Montana July-August, so not sure how far off this is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6/24/2008 \u0026#8211; Getting back to adding some photos here, micro-shots from looking under the scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first micro-shot is of a gill edge in Meltzer\u0026#8217;s at 400\u0026#215;.  Here you can see the long filamentous cheilocystidia.  The cystidia were seen along the edge, as you can see not solid cystidia, but in between basidia.  There were no pleurocystidia seen, except near to the gill edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micro-shot is of the cap surface at 400x, at least at the layer where the pileus trama ends, and the pileipellis hyphae start.  The hyphae of the surface are long and thin, and grow from the pileus trama straight up and interweave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third micro-shot is of some of the surface filamentous hyphae, at 400\u0026#215;.  Here if you look carefully you can see clear clamp connections at each septa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forth micro-shot is of spores at 1000\u0026#215;.  Unfortunately here I can\u0026#8217;t get mature spores from the stipe apex, there is no stipe.  I didn\u0026#8217;t see much from the cap surface, so these are probably spores from the gill.  In any case, you can mostly see the light warted surface, which was hard to get in focus for a photo.  It could only really be seen moving the focus in and out, but it kinda comes through here in this shot.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":5758,"consensus_name":"Crepidotus pallidoluteus","location_id":258,"location_name":"Eastern Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":14043},{"id":7798,"type":"observation","date":"2008-05-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.36558,"created_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","updated_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","number_of_views":25,"last_viewed":"2024-01-25T04:52:58.000Z","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":546,"consensus_name":"Crucibulum laeve","location_id":258,"location_name":"Eastern Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":14045},{"id":7799,"type":"observation","date":"2008-05-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.0,"created_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","updated_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","number_of_views":51,"last_viewed":"2023-12-30T09:51:00.000Z","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":1202,"consensus_name":"Discina perlata","location_id":258,"location_name":"Eastern Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":14046},{"id":7800,"type":"observation","date":"2008-05-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.0,"created_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","updated_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","number_of_views":13,"last_viewed":"2024-01-24T20:54:28.000Z","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":791,"consensus_name":"Gautieria","location_id":258,"location_name":"Eastern Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou Co., California, USA"},{"id":7801,"type":"observation","date":"2008-05-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.0,"created_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","updated_at":"2024-03-01T03:58:34.000Z","number_of_views":33,"last_viewed":"2024-01-28T21:08:21.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound on the inside of red fir bark, from a rotting stump.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":18,"consensus_name":"Gymnopus bakerensis","location_id":258,"location_name":"Eastern Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":14047},{"id":7802,"type":"observation","date":"2008-05-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.0,"created_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","updated_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","number_of_views":45,"last_viewed":"2024-03-01T09:35:44.000Z","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":1002,"consensus_name":"Gyromitra esculenta","location_id":258,"location_name":"Eastern Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":14050},{"id":7803,"type":"observation","date":"2008-05-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.26709,"created_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T09:10:35.000Z","number_of_views":37,"last_viewed":"2023-12-30T09:01:59.000Z","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":2418,"consensus_name":"Gyromitra montana","location_id":258,"location_name":"Eastern Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":14051},{"id":7804,"type":"observation","date":"2008-05-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.70317,"created_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T09:10:22.000Z","number_of_views":40,"last_viewed":"2023-12-28T12:47:21.000Z","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":61639,"consensus_name":"Guepiniopsis alpina","location_id":258,"location_name":"Eastern Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":14053},{"id":7805,"type":"observation","date":"2008-05-31","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.48004,"created_at":"2008-06-11T19:35:29.000Z","updated_at":"2008-06-11T23:56:23.000Z","number_of_views":41,"last_viewed":"2024-02-02T10:38:01.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOnly small ones were found this time.
