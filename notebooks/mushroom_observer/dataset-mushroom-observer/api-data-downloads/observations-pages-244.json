It feeds off the plant’s own supplies thereby weakening it. This is the reason why gardeners hate it. Taxonomy of rust fungi is very \u0026#8216;difficult\u0026#8217; (see number of synonym names for Phragmidium mucronatumit above!). Also its life cycle is very complex. Leaf rust of roses grows through several different stages. It produces four different forms of spores. The original pustules (aecia) produce aecidospores (each spore has two nuclei, they appear usually in chains), which infect other leaves or other parts of the plant and in turn produce the yellow-orange pustules and wounds. They form urediniospores (dikaryotic spores, which disperse widely, spreading infection), which germinate to form black pustules. They contain teliospores (thick-walled resting spores) which overwinter on fallen leaves, to germinate in the spring producing basidiospores (spores produced by specialized fungal cells called basidia), which are blown by wind. Pictures show the orange, spring time stage with urediospores.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":26916,"consensus_name":"Phragmidium mucronatum","location_id":6746,"location_name":"Krk Island, Croatia","primary_image_id":738232},{"id":276575,"type":"observation","date":"2017-04-30","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.59784,"created_at":"2017-05-15T19:36:45.000Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T19:36:51.000Z","number_of_views":50,"last_viewed":"2024-02-23T10:30:27.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s hard to believe it\u0026#8217;s another \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_name/Rinodina\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eRinodina\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.
