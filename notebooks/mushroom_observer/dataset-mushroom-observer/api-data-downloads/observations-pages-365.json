The best way to describe their appearance is like a mold that is consuming small shoots of grass.   They were found growing only within the middle of a clump of grass.  The blades of grass were also unique in that they were almost black in color, reflective, very thin/wispy, and easily matted (they did not rebound to original shape when touched).  The clump was only approximately 4 inches in diameter.  The whole arrangement was found among relatively dry, fibrous, slightly decomposed organic matter beneath an ironwood tree and nearby oak.
