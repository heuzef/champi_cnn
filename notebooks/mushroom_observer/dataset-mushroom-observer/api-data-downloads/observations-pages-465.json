Peridium white, encrusted with leafy debris, with abundant rhizomorphs. Peridium context stains orange-ish when cut, gleba very pale olive and firm gelatinous. Peridium not separable, 2-layered, with a narrow outer layer composed of interwoven filamentous, 1um thick hyphae and abundant crystals, and a thicker, parenchymous inner layer. Gleba composed of minute, empty locules (mature specimens, with handlens) lined with a hymenium. Basidia are long (30+mm) and cylindrical with an irregular outline, 5-6 spores, and a basal clamp. Spores globose to subglobose with a pedicel, echinulate when mature, inamyloid, about 5-6um long. Basidia and outer peridial hyphae brown in iodine solution.
