awesome neighbor told me where she saw one these on xmas eve. I couldn\u0026#8217;t believe it. And she had no idea what it was. I took a chance and a drive to see if I could find it. Glad I did because I found a whole group of them. This mushroom is completely legal to pic and possess. But take great care if you intend to ingest it. There is a lot of information that says not to. For my research that I have done so far, the Safe way to experience it would be drying and  make tea.or a lemon tek. Discarding the plant matter.a powerful and fabled psychedelic. Closely related to xmas. Again, always great care and identifying. And research research research.  Also whenever you try something new no matter it is an edible or what always start with a very small portion . No matter how sure of it you are. And also, merry Christmas to me! And everybody out there.
