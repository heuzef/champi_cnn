The caps ranged from 3-37mm. wide by 1-8 mm. high at center.  The stipe at the base ranged from 2-6mm. diameter, and the length of the stipes was 5-25mm.  Trama thickness was 1mm,at the center and the stipes were from 1-9mm. diameter at the apex.  Shape of the pileus was convex to plane, becoming uplifted.  There were some shallow, narrow pits on the disc in some specimens.  Pilei were orbicular in top view, and the margins were decurved at first, then upturned in older specimens. On younger mushrooms the margin was entire and striate.  the pilei were moist and shiny.

White, downy hyphae was attached to the base of the stipe. (basal tomentum)?  The stipes were hollow and some were compressed.  Stipe was equal to tapering slightly towards the base, and the stipe was very finely longitudinaly striate.  The stipe was leathery in that I could bend it in half without breaking it.  It/they were hollow.\u003cbr /\u003e\n    Young specimens had a partial veil that left fibrils just below the apex.
