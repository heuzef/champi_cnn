found about a dozen fruiting solitary but in the same general area and habitat (from clay soil on the side of the trail). They all appear to be the same species, I believe few got a chance to fully develop with the weird weather patterns we have had recently, so many buttons were dry with an unexpanded cap. The passing of tropical storm Isaías dumped several inches of rain on El Yunque, but immediately afterwards dry conditions returned and the forest remains in drought worsened by the fact that the storm ripped open new holes in the canopy which allows the sun to dry up the understory.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSpores about 6-7 um, rarely exceeding 7. Setaceous hyphae present at the base of the stipe. Cheilocystidia is very heteromorphous, and I saw many forms and shapes that are not illustrated in the literature (see drawing). I looked at two individuals and they did not have pigmented cystidia, which all look consistently hyaline. This trait seems to vary according to a collection made around 2018 which I scoped with Jean Lodged and we found individuals with and without pigmented cystidia that otherwise agreed in all other traits observed. The publication \u0026#8216;New Species of Psilocybe in the Caribbean\u0026#8217; (2003) also mentions that a collection from the Dominican Republic \u0026#8220;lacks the yellowish or grayish opaque pleurocystidia and the brownish or grayish opaque cheilocystidia that are typical of P. guilartensis\u0026#8221; but that \u0026#8220;the presence of the highly distinctive setaceous hyphae at the base of the stipe indicates this collection has strong phenotypic affinities with P. guilartensis\u0026#8221; and that \u0026#8220;the lack of pigments\u0026#8230;might be due to the immaturity of the specimens\u0026#8221;.

spot on 5-Aug-20 (to be posted later) supports this notion, but some salient morphological features of the present collection suggest it could be a different taxon.  For example, the cap surface closer to the margins is heavily covered in dense clusters of tufts of erect fibrils or scabers, giving it a wrinkled appearance.  The stipes feature a fine, but obvious, elongated netting that transitions into an almost smooth surface sprinkled with small brown spots and smears intermixed with some scruffiness.  Another interesting feature was revealed upon sectioning: the flesh right under the pileipellis eventually stained grayish-green in older specimens.  Upon further examination, when peeled, the undersurface of the thick cuticle (up to 1 mm thick) and the surface of the flesh immediately below the cuticle were found to be yellow.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe largest caps (fruitbodies 1 \u0026amp; 2) had a 10-11 cm footprint, with a flesh thickness above the stipe of 2.5-2.7 cm.

Other than that the two sequences are identical.  The point of heterogeneity is in located in late ITS2 region, 48 bases away from LSU (see Fig.1).\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn the presence of a single point of heterogeneity, full-length sequences are usually obtained by stitching the two reads at the point of sequence \u0026#8220;derailment\u0026#8221;, also provided that the reads are clean and show SSU \u0026amp; LSU regions where aplicon/sequencing primers originate.  However, here noise obscures the 5\u0026#8217; and 3\u0026#8217; ends of the sequence in the forward and reverse reads, respectively.  That said, while the forward read delivers the bulk of sequence, the 3\u0026#8217; end of it had to be resolved all the way to ITS6R primer to get the late ITS2 and the adjacent LSU fragment.  To get the left hand side of the sequence (SSU fragment and early ITS1), the reverse read had to be worked on to resolve the two haplotypes.  When the dust settled, I had the entire sequence between the amplicon primers, and 63% of it was supported by both reads (the consensus portion).
