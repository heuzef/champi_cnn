My first and only hands-on experience with this new taxon that I from now on shall refer to as \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_glossary_term/pseudosclerotiorum\"\u003e\u003ci\u003epseudosclerotiorum\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#8221; dates back to fall 2015.  Obviously seeing enough of both species on regular basis will eventually lead to better probabilities of field ID and shaping up of species concepts.  Also, so far ecological evidence points to a difference in habitat: \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_glossary_term/sclerotiorum\"\u003e\u003ci\u003esclerotiorum\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e seems to prefer the acidic sandy soil of pine-oak woods of the outer coastal plains (though \u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_observation/249019\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eobs 249019\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is likely an exception in this regard), whereas my collections of \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://mushroomobserver.org/lookups/lookup_glossary_term/pseudosclerotiorum\"\u003e\u003ci\u003epseudosclerotiorum\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#8221; came from an upland/inland hemlock-hardwood forest of southwestern MA and mixed deciduous woods of NJ, both with loam-clay type soil.
