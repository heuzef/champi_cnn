Breitenbach Ref.: 2 and Krieglsteiner Ref.:4 consider both as synonyms. Tricholoma monograph Ref.:6 doesn\u0026#8217;t treat Tricholoma argyraceus as an independent species but (only briefly) as a subspecies of Tricholoma scalpturatum. Contrary Index Fungorum and MycoBank consider both names as valid names of two independent species. As far as I was able to study this find it fits reasonably well to the traits of Tricholoma scalpturatum. However, the facts that observed yellowing of the stipe and lamellae (typical for T. scalpturatum but not for T. argyraceus, Ref.:6) was quite modest (see picture #5, right most pileus), that the mushrooms were found under Betula pendula (Ref.:7 lists this tree as a known mycorrhizal partner only for T. argyraceus) and that the measured average Q of the spores is 1.6 (according to Ref.:7 it should be: 1.3 \u0026lt; Q \u0026lt; 1.5 for T. scalpturatum and 1.5 \u0026lt; Q \u0026lt; 1.9 for T. scalpturatum) speak in favor of alternative and less common Tricholoma argyraceus. Probably only an elaborate microscopy would give an answer to this dilemma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing in scattered groups of several pilei, altogether more than thirty pilei; pilei diameter up to 4(5) cm; SP whitish, oac851.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":3859,"consensus_name":"Tricholoma scalpturatum","location_id":739,"location_name":"Zadnja Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":572009},{"id":221831,"type":"observation","date":"2015-11-04","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.74322,"created_at":"2015-11-05T13:15:44.000Z","updated_at":"2019-01-06T13:20:29.000Z","number_of_views":18,"last_viewed":"2023-02-21T03:05:43.000Z","owner_id":1909,"consensus_id":2760,"consensus_name":"Lactarius oculatus","location_id":5787,"location_name":"Walsingham, Ontario, Canada","primary_image_id":572019},{"id":221833,"type":"observation","date":"2015-11-03","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.51823,"created_at":"2015-11-05T16:09:53.000Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T16:11:15.000Z","number_of_views":24,"last_viewed":"2023-12-26T15:39:05.000Z","owner_id":4186,"consensus_id":3284,"consensus_name":"Phallus rubicundus","location_id":7519,"location_name":"Southwest St. Louis Co., Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":572024},{"id":221834,"type":"observation","date":"2015-11-03","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.56693,"created_at":"2015-11-05T16:39:53.000Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T16:43:25.000Z","number_of_views":88,"last_viewed":"2024-03-17T13:30:14.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eSingle fruit-body growing on ground in mostly Sitka spruce habitat.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSpores ~ 25 X 13.5 microns, bi-gluttulate.

Lloyd\u0026#8221;, vol. 4, p. 523:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u0026#8220;The account of Fomes juniperinus in North American Flora was evidently made up from the original publication, and reproduces a number of errors. The spores are merely stated to be reddish brown smooth which was copied verbatim. They are so pale colored that they appear hyaline under a low power. Spines blunt, etc., also copied. The plant has no spines or cystidia as originally stated. I think accidental projecting hyphae have been so mistaken. I have long suspected that Fomes juniperinus is the same as Fomes Demidoffii, known from a single specimen, in the Museum at Paris, from Russia. Both are rare plants, the former known from but few collections, the latter from the type only in the museum at Paris. Both grow on the red cedar (Juniperinus). Both have a black, rimose surface. Both have reddish context, and exactly the same spores. In fact they are the same plant in every particular, and Fomes Demidoffii is prior, if one wants to use such an uncouth name. For my part, I do not intend to do so. While the plant is rare in our Southern States, it is quite common, I am told by Prof. Long, in the Southwest New Mexico, growing on various species of Juniperinus.  Although it is exactly the same plant as Fomes Juniperinus, and fruiting specimens can not be distinguished by any character, Mr. Murrill with his usual liberality discovered that the New Mexican plant was a new species, which he calls Fomes Earlei. Messrs. Hedgcock and \u003cbr /\u003e\nLong have recently published that Fomes Juniperinus and Fomes Earlei produce different kinds of rots in the host, While I know nothing on this subject. I venture it will be found to be a mistake of some kind when the real truth is learned. I feel so sure that the fruiting bodies are absolutely the same that I question if it can produce a different rot in different localities, though I can not say to the contrary.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":429,"consensus_id":62527,"consensus_name":"Pyrofomes juniperinus","location_id":6847,"location_name":"Myron and Sonya Glasberg Conservation Area, Missouri, USA","primary_image_id":572379},{"id":221924,"type":"observation","date":"2015-10-17","latitude":"43.3847","longitude":"-80.3729","altitude":273,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.66071,"created_at":"2015-11-06T16:56:57.000Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T02:00:03.000Z","number_of_views":103,"last_viewed":"2024-04-10T00:17:29.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eRecently restored tall grass prairie (a few years ago), incredibly common over a certain area, couldn\u0026#8217;t help but step on.
