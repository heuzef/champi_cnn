Majority and largest basidiome are growing from a \u0026#8216;centennial tree\u0026#8217; or large diameter indet. angiosperm. Some also appear to be growing from a fairly old mango tree alongside the centennial tree. Context is dark brown, fairly homogenous with concentric growth rings and scattered resinous bands. Old basidiome has entire cuticle cells (perhaps consistent with Ryvarden\u0026#8217;s diagnosis of G. oerstedii (Torres-Torres 2014) but the young basidiome I examined had typical protruberances. Chlamydospores present in context. Contextual skeletal hyphae very dark brown in KOH, nodulose where branching. Basidiospores large and broad, sometimes up to 10um diam.

nice group of still young pilei of this interesting species was growing under an old large mountain Picea abies. This is unusual since this species more frequently grows on broadleaved trees. The grown up pilei become much larger than those shown on these pictures. Pholiota squarrosa is quite a common mushroom here. Its determination is not difficult because of its typical habit and characteristic scales all over it. Yet, mistakes are not impossible since at least three other very similar species of this genus grow in Slovenia \u0026#8211;  Pholiota aurivella, Pholiota adiposa and Pholiota jahinii (Ref.1.) Pholiota aurivella grows on Salix and is only somewhat viscid or dry while Pholiota squarosa is always dry, without slime.
