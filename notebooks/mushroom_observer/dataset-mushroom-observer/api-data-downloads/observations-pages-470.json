perplexing Hygrocybe that seems to shift colors with the environment. When observed in a semi-dry state the next day, the pileus was dark maroon and the gill edge even appeared green! Looking at other photos of H. prieta with the more typically green hymenium and dark pileus, I am convinced it is that. It is possible that the fresh specimens like this one are more brightly pigmented, or it could be a color variety or just a closely related taxon. Microscopically the dimorphic spores fit the measurements of H. prieta in Lodge (1990) and it keys out to this taxon. H. naranjana is discussed as a taxon that closely resembles H. prieta, and the colors of the dry specimen match the illustration in Dennis (1970) almost perfectly.
