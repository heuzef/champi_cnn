Fruiting bodies are found on this substrate from mid July-September periodically.  Annual fruiting of G.oregonense and G.tsugae are a regular collection for our pantry every season.  Cold and flu season are a cool breeze when using these PNW strains for tea.  NOTE: start your weekly regimen of daily shots(in the A.M.) of Reishi tea around mid August and continue until January for best results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Never harvest these fresh Reishi at the \u0026#8220;marshmallow stage\u0026#8221;(as with this image); rather, wait until the specimens have completely become flat and planed out.  As the white leading edge decreases in mass of the cap- the chocolate brown spore bearing structure will increase in height and almost completely fill the cap.  Harvest when spore mass has covered the cap of specimen and the entire fruiting body is deep chocolate brown when sliced.  This will ensure that adequate spore dispersal in the habitat will continue each and every year(as these are annual polypores).  If all were to be harvested at the stage of the sporophore in this post we would run out of reishi within a few summers.  I have successfully harvested at this location for more than just over 8 seasons now. I have introduced many strains of Ganoderma here, as well.  Most harvest and transplant of stem butts came from Mora campground and 3rd. beach WA.  We even successfully inoculated the end of an already proliferated(with G.applanatum and F.pinicola) Western hemlock log.  The following year in a one foot section of the log were very large, marshmallowing G.oregonense in the exact location we inoculated.
