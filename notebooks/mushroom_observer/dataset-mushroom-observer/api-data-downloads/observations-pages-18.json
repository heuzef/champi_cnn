There are these two deep grey Hygrophorus sited in Largent\u0026#8217;s Hygrophorus of CA, and each of them were listed from only one sample found.  One is the H. marzuolus, which is usually found in the spring up in the Sierras.  I\u0026#8217;ve seen a few of these, and have a few dried samples.  Then we also lists H. camarophyllus, from the caost in the fall.
