I have decided to expand my personal knowledge of mushrooms and would like to have a place (a website) where I can share images and information and consult with professionals. Hope this is the site! :) Here are some images of the latest mushrooms that we found that are not familiar to us. Please help with identification. This particular one was found in a grassland, right next to mixed woods (predominantly Oak though). There was only one of them. I did some research and it seems like it might be Amanita Macerisolum.
