Color is Deep Red/Scarlet, with slightly Orange Margins on Mature specimens.  The Center is darker and slightly Umbilicate in Younger specimens becoming deeper and wider in more-mature specimens, but ultimately Flattening out in very-mature Specimens.  Otherwise the shape is Convex at first, moving to Broadly Convex, and at maturity nearly flat with an Undulating Margin. The surface is dry and smooth but is slightly granulose/bumpy with older specimens.  Margin is predominantly Scalloped in line with the Major Gill Ends, otherwise appearing plane or straight, particularly in younger specimens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGILLS:\tPredominantly Salmon colored with Pale Yellow Edges, Sub-decurrent, Close but Unequal with many Short Gills of varying lengths.  The Major Gills have a Ventricose shape and have an even/regular margin with some Erosion on Older Specimens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTIPE:\tLength is significant when compared to the Cap Size, regardless of Specimen Maturity.    Immature/”baby” specimens have a length of 2.5 cm at 1 mm width!  Otherwise length gets as long as 6 cm without any association with Cap width or Specimen Age.  Stipe width ranges from 2 – 5 mm, with Older Specimens being Wider. The Stipe Color is predominantly the same color as the Cap, becoming Paler, almost Translucent White at the Base.  Equal, sometimes Compressed, but always with Central attachment.  The Surface is Dry, and smooth w/occasional horizontally arranged “bumpiness” at irregular intervals on some specimens. The Stipe is Hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFLESH:\tNo variation from the External Colors where cut or bruised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSPORES:\tUnknown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMYCELIA:\tWhat little there appear to be, they look short and transparent.  It is important to note that the Base of the Specimen ENTIRELY ENCAPSULATES Moss Fronds, so this species is either ENDOMYCORRHIZAL or SAPROPHYTIC.

Cladonia rappii as well as Cladonia cervikornis/verticilata look similarly from far, but proliferate strictly from the center of the cups. Cladonia ramulosa may look similar too, but rarely (if at all) proliferates in more than two stores and is usually fertile with numerous conspicuous brown apothecia. None of several specimens found in this observation had podetia with apothecia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best, although not ideal, fit I\u0026#8217;ve found seems to be Cladonia phyllophora. All sources agree that this taxon is highly polymorphic (google the pictures of it!). The taxon is also very variously interpreted by the authors (Ref. 7.). The description in literature, which seems the closest to this find, is in Brodo, Sharnoff, Sharnoff (2001) (Ref. 2.) mentioning gradually broadening and seemingly soft near the apex podetia having a slightly puffed-up aspect and cup margins richly decorated by small and thick squamules (see Fig. 4.) and numerous brown pycnidia /see Fig.7.). The description in Smith at al (2009) (Ref. 1.) fits reasonably well too, particularly the description of the habit stated as \u0026#8216;often extensive more or less interlocking tiers of proliferating podetia\u0026#8217;. However, many sources mention that the surface of the podetia near the base should be areolate with contrasting blackened decorticated and maculated areas (Ref. 1., Ref. 8.) or blackish podetia base (Ref. 7.), which is not the case in this find. Also substratum is usually cited as acid. This find apparently grew on a mixture of sandy soil and raw hummus deposited in gaps among large rock boulders (a few meters across) of a relatively recent large mountain rock slide. It seems possible that it was at least to some extent acid, however, the bedrock and the boulders themselves are no doubt calcareous. I am not sure my determination is correct, but, I am also not aware of a better alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamera: Nikon D70 / Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":8696,"consensus_name":"Cladonia phyllophora","location_id":673,"location_name":"Bovec basin, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":1334983},{"id":455229,"type":"observation","date":"2021-06-13","latitude":"47.3903","longitude":"-122.0454","altitude":343,"gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.55158,"created_at":"2021-06-14T17:53:46.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-16T10:42:26.000Z","number_of_views":170,"last_viewed":"2024-04-06T05:38:00.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound in woodchips / mulch.
