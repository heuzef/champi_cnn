These look a lot more like T. zelleri; especially like the photo in Miller\u0026#8217;s manual. But there was no foul odor or disagreeable taste as is mentioned in most decriptions of T. zelleri. These specimens had a slight but pleasant odor. The taste was also agreeable. I sliced and fried one button in olive oil with some salt and onion, and the result was good; somewhat strong flavored, but not in a bad way.

There the lichens have been subject to considerable grazing pressure from a resident herd of caribou since the last ice age. We saw about 35 caribou in the area on the day we took these photos, and the effect of their grazing is obvious. The best looking lichens are largely confined to more inaccessible cracks between boulders. In other parts of their range, caribou migrate, even over enormous distances, spreading out their grazing pressure, but on Mont Jaques-Cartier the small herd does not leave the top of the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdentification: There are two species of Ophioparma in eastern North America, distinguished mainly on the basis of spore characteristics: O. lapponica which has a subarctic distribution extending in eastern North America as far south as Labrador, and O. ventosa which in eastern North America is found from Quebec, Labrador, and Newfoundland to northern New England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReference: Philip F.

All of these tend to have some amount of focus or subject-position issues, owing to the confined space under the log and resulting difficulty in positioning the camera. Even its orientation was often constrained by obstructions in the way of the nozzle containing the lenses.

carefully reading and studing numerous pictures of the Golden Chanterelle I believe this is a representation of a Chanterelle found in the woods of Pennsylvaina just south of Harrisburg. I compared it to some of the species that are often confused as a Chanterelle like the Jack O lantern. It has all of the characteristic that would lead me to believe it is in fact a Golden Chanterelle. I found this mushroom in several locations all within a 5 mile radius of each mushroom. The habitat is conducive to their exsistence. Hardwoods, Oaks, Hemlocks, leaf litter, acorns and ferns, The fact that they were found growing on the ground not on rotting wood at all the locations I visited also is an indicator. The coloring, shape of the vein like gills, the shape which is trumpet like, color, and various stages of their growth I observed suggest it is a Golden Chanterelle. I did a cross section cut of one of the larger mushrooms I harvested which revealed a solid white center. I gingerly took a very small taste which was peppery in taste on the palate. The smell is a mild mushroom odor sweet and mellow. The top portion of the mushroom is a deep egg yolk yellow to orange color and resembles the flower of a golden day lilly with ruffled edges. This is the first time I have ever gone searching for mushrooms. I am detail oriented and hope this is a good description for the identification purpose of the mushrooms listed in this post.

New to mushroom hunting. This is a light colored lavender to purple mushroom. There were several stages of maturity observed growing in groups of 3 to 5 not clustered but independant of each other. They were found in a forest of hard woods and ferns with profuse leaf litter. They were not growing on wood however they were growing in close proximtiy the larger trees. Oaks seemed to be the dominant tree in addition to Sasafrass trees to a lesser extent. The mushroom in question has a thick stipe larger at the base, with a domed cap (smaller in proportion to the stipe) which has a white solid appearance to its under side. The flesh has been eaten on some of the examples by slugs revealing a darker purple color under the surface of the cap. The stipe is smooth in texture with the lavender color the brightest toward the top of the cap, while lighter in color toward the base. The largest mushroom I found was roughly 3 inches in length. The mushroom was weighty for it size and seemed to be solid cored. I have a picture of the forest to show the density of the tree and their relative sizes.

At first I thought it to be just another drabby bolete.  Then I noticed that they where attached to what appear to be puff balls. I identified the puffball as a Scleroderma. I broke one open and there was a black spore mass. The only thing this could be is  Boletus paraciticus.Now weather this is an actual parasite may be debated. I have been examined this site for awhile and although a bolete seems to pop up right out of the puffball the host is not affected. The term parasitic usually refers to organism living  at the expense of the host. Case in Point is Cordyceps. If you look at the host of the cordyceps you will notice that the inside of the pupae is full of mycellem/ Where as the Scleroderma appears unscathed by its boletus attached to it. The spore mass of the Scleroderma is still able to release spores . Im wondering if its not more of a symbiotic relationship with each other They  benefit each other in some way.

Here are my observations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHabitat: Found on mainly oak leaf litter in a mixed hardwood forest, about 50 yards up a slope from a small creek. The largest nearby tree is a red oak. There are also beeches, tulips and two very young maples in the immediate vicinity. No conifers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSize of patch: The entire patch extends about 15 feet from the red oak and is about 12 feet at its widest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClustering: In the patch there are several somewhat round fused clusters, several arcs of singles and doubles, and several random groupings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSize of clusters/caps: The largest, nicely shaped cluster was about 10 inches across. One of its caps was nearly 6 inches in diameter. The single caps and easily separated doubles were from 2½ to 3½  inches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCap grooves and ridges: Closeup photos show the grooves and ridges in the caps, which is apparent on all caps throughout the patch. Older caps, though still ridged, appear slightly flatter. On a dry day, the white margin has a peach-fuzz effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth: I was not able to see the teeth with the naked eye.

A cross-section shows the teeth shorten considerably towards the margin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStipe: The stipe is firm, but somewhat pliable, but the base is very rigid.
