I have a positive ID now\u0026#8230; Endocalyx melanoxanthus var. melanoxanthus . These are Ascomycetes\u0026#8230; The last image here is one of several microscope images of spores taken from the specimens. I attribute the ID and this image to Heino Lepp at the Herbarium in Canberra. He has remarkably found an obscure reference from a paper written in 1908. There have been a number of sightings around the world. Here in Australia, there is a reference to a Japanese team who collected samples from the Daintree for the Herbarium in Hong Kong. It is also possible that it may exist in one of our Herbariums but this has not been explored. Nonetheless it is a rare find at this time in Australia!!
