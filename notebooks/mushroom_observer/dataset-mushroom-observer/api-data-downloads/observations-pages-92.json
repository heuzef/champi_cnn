The spores which are fully filled stain amber in Melzer\u0026#8217;s, while others with smaller droplets are nearly clear. All spores photographed were from the spore print and should represent mature spores. The spores seem especially fragile with many ruptured and releasing numerous oil droplets on the slide.
