It fruits steadily (for an Amanita) in several spots around Akademgorodok, i.e. I\u0026#8217;ve seen it more than once in each of those particular spots. It\u0026#8217;s a very generic-looking white Amanita sect. Vaginatae with two macroscopic features that are very confusing. First of all, it\u0026#8217;s not always white. Normally the fruitbodies are white just as you\u0026#8217;d expect from A. vaginata var. alba, but in dry weather grayer fruitbodies appear, ranging from white with grayer center to uniform warm pale gray. Secondly, the volva \u0026#8211; it has rusty stains like A. fulva. At first I\u0026#8217;d thought it was a particular fruitbody affected with some disease but then I saw the same orange discolorations in other specimens from other locations (all within a 3 km radius). Also, the volva appears to be rather fragile, never forming a nice cleenex-like sack \u0026#8211; there are usually some fragments at the base of the stipe and sometimes (but not always) some stuck to the cap surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m attaching pictures of three finds of what I think is the same species \u0026#8211; despite the dramatic difference in the range of striations on the cap.
