It attracts ants and other insects, both on healthy and infected plants. For over 100 years this host-pathogen pair has been subject to much speculation concerning the function of nectar-producing spermatia.

I have loaded different sized images to provide full advantage of Raw file facilities. After taking many shots at vatrious angles I have short listed them to the ones loaded. After carefully removing the two specimens , which seemed to have very long fine root system I rephotographed them. Then I bisected the larger of the two specimens. After another couple of record shots, I noticed that the white area (inner) was going blue. This was I would guess, bruising or some chemical effect, when the moisture(rain ) was allowed to reach to the exposed surface.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe largest fungi was 2.5 cm in length, and about 1cm across the widest section of the body.

Basidia are long and thin (34 X4) with no clamp that I could find at the bottom, but I never got an ideal view because the hymenium was too tough to squish and too rubbery to cut thinly.  This may improve after drying.  The gray velvety look of the hymenium is caused by the cystidia, and this is apparently common in Peniophora. Some of the lamprocystidia were over 100 um in length.

acid and Beta D glucans aid in boosting human immune functions- this mushroom as well as other Ganoderma species are full of complex triterpenoids and polysacharides which aid in fighting cancer, HIV and other ailments such as staph infections.  I recommend learning about and consuming these species for all people(not just those who are noticeably sick or in recovery) as a preventative holistic approach to wellness.  Most Ganoderma species(G. lucidum, G. oregonense, G. capense, G. sinense, G. tsugae) are annual polypores and fruit in warm summer months in temperate climates- G. applanatum, however, is a perennial polypore that releases spores and begins fruiting of young species in these summer months-but continues to fruit slowly and drop trillions of spores annually- so unlike all the \u0026#8220;varnish\u0026#8221; Gano\u0026#8217;s  it is great to have such a beneficial polypore year round along with T. versicolor for tea and tinctures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor excellent literature on medicinal value and procurement methods for medicinal mushrooms please read author Christopher Hobbs\u0026#8217; incredible book \u0026#8220;Medicinal Mushrooms.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this observation you can see bright white leading edges extending from the young specimens beginning to form new white spore bearing flesh as summer approaches.
