These mushrooms often have a ring zone / collar of dark spores where an annulus would be.

found this last night close to a larch tree on my property.  One of the nicest Agaricus specimens I have ever found.  I used a key to Agaricus mushrooms from mushroomexpert.com and ultimately came to Agaricus subrufescens but I\u0026#8217;m not 100% confident on that.  It seems like a good possibility though due to the fact that there was evident yellow bruising on the cap margin but no yellow staining when a section was sliced from the stem base.  It is also fairly robust which also seems to point me in that direction.  No considerable odor/scent was detected but perhaps my sense of smell just isn\u0026#8217;t that great.  I know Agaricus subrufescens should have a smell similar to almonds.
