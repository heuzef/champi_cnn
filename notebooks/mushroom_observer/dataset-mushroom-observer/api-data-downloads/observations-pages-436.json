These species were synonymized by Singer (1945), and \u003ccite\u003eG. subalbellus\u003c/cite\u003e has since been the name in use. In the sense of Murrill’s descriptions and type material, \u003ccite\u003eG. subalbellus\u003c/cite\u003e spores are more ovoid to subreniform (~ 7.5–10 × 4–5.5 μm) and the pileus is finely tomentose to nearly glabrous, while \u003ccite\u003eG. roseialbus\u003c/cite\u003e spores are distinctly elongate (~ 11–13 × 4–5 μm) and the pileus is glabrous to nearly so. Other morphological aspects differ as well, such as coloration, but these are somewhat more variable across geographic range and the physical development of the basidiomes. In the light of further sampling in the residual clade, an elusive group with obscure morphology that is echoed by Murrill’s original description of \u003ccite\u003eG. subalbellus\u003c/cite\u003e, it seems clear that \u003ccite\u003eG. roseialbus\u003c/cite\u003e is distinct from \u003ccite\u003eG. subalbellus\u003c/cite\u003e, as indicated in Fig. 1. However, given the diverse and cryptic nature of the residual clade, the exact identity of \u003ccite\u003eG. subalbellus\u003c/cite\u003e is unclear since there are likely more North American species in this clade, and no recent collections have been made from the type locality (Ocean Springs, Mississippi).\u0026#8221;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cins\u003eReferences\u003c/ins\u003e:\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003csup class=\"footnote\" id=\"fnr1\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fn1\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e Davoodian et al. \u0026#8220;A global view of \u003ccite\u003eGyroporus\u003c/cite\u003e: molecular phylogenetics, diversity patterns, and new species\u0026#8221;, \u003ccite\u003eMycologia\u003c/cite\u003e \u003cb\u003e110\u003c/b\u003e(5), 985–995 (2018)\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003csup class=\"footnote\" id=\"fnr2\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fn2\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e Davoodian et al. \u0026#8220;Diversity of Gyroporus (Gyroporaceae, Boletales): \u003ccite\u003erpb2\u003c/cite\u003e phylogeny and three new species\u0026#8221;, \u003ccite\u003ePhytotaxa\u003c/cite\u003e \u003cb\u003e434\u003c/b\u003e (3): 208–218 (2020)\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":1539,"consensus_id":45403,"consensus_name":"Gyroporus roseialbus","location_id":1136,"location_name":"Brendan T.

In some cases the print is very pale, possibly mistaken for white. (I have read accounts where the print is reported as \u0026#8220;white\u0026#8221;.) Recently, a member of our local club collected what she IDed as L. nuda (the photo posted online appeared to confirm the ID). The spore print color she got seemed very dark. \u003cbr /\u003e\nI then collected some L. nuda which I printed. Four collections(A, B, C, D) made from the same location produced fairly pigmented prints. But in one case the print featured distinctly contrasting lighter and darker areas.
