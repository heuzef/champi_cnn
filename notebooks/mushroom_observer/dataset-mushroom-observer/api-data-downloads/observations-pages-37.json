I contacted Hal Burdsall, who was still at Forest Products in Madison then, and he told me there are no yellow tones, ever, in P. dryinus.  I then showed him the specimens, which he said were conclusively not P. dryinus, but he did not recognize it.  They were too young for spores, and I had dried them all anyway (which kills the the spores, making it impossible to culture them), so the next week-end we returned the 100 miles north-west of Madison to Wildcat Mountain to get some for culturing.  The log they were on was near the trail, and only a few hundred yards off the parking lot, so I expected to find it again. Luckily, no one had destroyed the ones I had left, and they were indeed there. In only six days the appearence of this mushroom had changed more than almost any I have ever seen. It had become very much larger, was now densely covered with hairs on the cap and especially the stem (noted as characteristic of Panus strigosus Berkeley and Curtis and by Peck, for specimens found in 1872 and repeated verbatum by McElvaine in 1902), and become much yellower. All traces of the veil apparent in the buttons were gone.  Although it is not one of the most-covered species, the specimens first found on June 27th were now easily recognizable as P. strigosus from the more extensive descriptions and illustrations of this species in Kauffman (1918), O. K. Miller (1977), Smith, Smith, and Weber (1979), and Phillips (1991).  I recognized it immediately because it is very distinctive, and I had seen it previously in three different years at Baxter\u0026#8217;s Hollow as well as at Devils Lake and in the Smoky Mountains.  Most surprisingly, however, P. strigosus was absent from the extensive species list of for the Smoky Mountains. I think it is clear that none of the above authors could ever have seen buttons of “Panus strigosus”; they are quite unrecognizable from the descriptions given.   However, I think what has happened is clear.  There is a second, related species, Panus levis B. \u0026amp; C. (originally spelled lævis using a diphthong, later not, and the spelling has often been \u0026#8220;modernized\u0026#8221; to levis, as in IF), that is less commonly described. I wasn\u0026#8217;t thinking of it at all, because my edition of Hard (1908, 1976 Dover reprint) has updated nomenclature (by Gilliam in 1975), noting that Singer moved P. laevis to Pleurotus. This unfortunately put them in different genera in my order, and I never connected the two. This difficulty was only slightly less than finding them in Kauffman\u0026#8217;s book, where the Panus key starts on p. 44 and Pleurotus key on p. 658. in the other volume. Nevertheless, Kauffman notes that strigosus and laevis are rather close (although he only describes laevis with 23 words in a key entry; he never thought that he saw it) and that strigosus is hard to tell from a Pleurotus. McIlvaine also clearly says that the two species are related, and Singer, who transferred both to Pleurotus, notes that the two species may be the same, which I think is the solution. Hessler (Mushrooms of the Great Smokies, 1960, reprint 1975) includes only Panus levis, and is the only one to state clearly that it has a veil when young (Peck, Hard, Kauffman and McIlvaine all use various other comments instead of calling it a veil).  This explains to my satisfaction why strigosus does not appear in the Smokey Mountains list; Hessler knows they are the same but doesn\u0026#8217;t bother to tell you, and uses Pleurotus (B. \u0026amp; C.)Singer, synonym Panus B. \u0026amp; C. as its name in the Smoky Mountain list. Comparing the descriptions when both species are included, laevis is smoother (under the \u0026#8220;matted hairs\u0026#8221;), less than half the size, and whiter. I think the conclusion is unavoidable that Berkeley and Curtis came up with two names for the same species, laevis for young ones, and strigosus for mature ones.
