It has distinctly stipitate pileus, continuous, partly shiny and reddish-brown (not dark brown and dull as with Ganoderma applanatum and Ganoderma australe) resinous crust, which first melts and then burns with a yellow flame when heated at the tip of a knife in the flame of a match and a darker line in context just above tube layer. However, some traits not mentioned in the keys pose problems. The context color doesn\u0026#8217;t seem to correspond well to the descriptions in Ryvarden (2014) and Krieglsteiner (2000) (\u0026#8216;pale grayish-brown\u0026#8217;) and Bernicchia (2005) (\u0026#8216;brown, red-brown\u0026#8217;). The find was found on dead stump of Ostrya carpinifolia (host species not listed as a possible substrate in the literature available to me) while Ganoderma resinaceum is known from live deciduous trees. Measured spores are slightly too long and too wide in average compared to most published data (the only exception is Ref.: 4). Their width fits better to similar Ganoderma pfeifferi, which is apparently always sessile and never stipitate. Measured spore dimensions actually fit perfectly to Ganoderma carnosum, which is, however, know only from conifers. Also the habitat of the find seems strange.  Ganoderma resinaceum is usually found in parks, roadsides, seldom in woods. All this makes my determination uncertain to some extent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing solitary; pileus dimensions 10 \u0026#215; 8 cm; oozing reddish droplets when cut, pore layer bruising brown when handled; trama fibrous-corky and very firm, difficult to cut even with a ceramic knife; taste bitter, smell distinctive, pleasant, a kind of mushroomy; SP faint, possibly brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":5697,"consensus_name":"Ganoderma resinaceum","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":583819},{"id":225570,"type":"observation","date":"2015-11-14","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.7384,"created_at":"2015-12-17T11:03:25.000Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T11:03:31.000Z","number_of_views":47,"last_viewed":"2022-09-02T22:21:21.000Z","owner_id":123,"consensus_id":2041,"consensus_name":"Cortinarius violaceus","location_id":12668,"location_name":"Capulálpam de Méndez, Oaxaca, Mexico","primary_image_id":583834},{"id":225571,"type":"observation","date":"2015-11-14","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.73843,"created_at":"2015-12-17T11:12:29.000Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T12:41:14.000Z","number_of_views":124,"last_viewed":"2024-03-04T15:56:55.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eUnder pine.

Many mycologists split it into three species or subspecies Daedaleopsis confragosa, Daedaleopsis tricolor and rare Daedaleopsis septentrionalis. They don\u0026#8217;t differ microscopically. But, indeed one can find strikingly different specimens having from small, vividly and beautifully red pilei to dirt whitish and pale beige-brown examples with any possible kind of pore surface one can imagine, from purely lamellate or elongated pores, sometimes labyrinthine to purely poroid. Taking into account only macroscopic traits it is hard to believe for a laymen that all these forms are one and the same species. The find photographed is interesting because of its unusual round form.
