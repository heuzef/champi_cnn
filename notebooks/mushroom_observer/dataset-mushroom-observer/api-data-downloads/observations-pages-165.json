It is not often encountered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor decades, from late 19th century on, Corallorhiza trifida had been considered an obligate myco-heterotrophic plant. Yet, although it has no true green leaves, its stem is at least to some extent green. From this and other reasons several doubts in its myco-heterotrophic nature have been arisen from time to time, but without final proofs. Only in 2007 scientists (Ref.:1.) clearly demonstrated that it contains significant amounts of chlorophyll of type a and b (both are needed for efficient photosynthesis) and that it is photo synthetically active. By analysis of their carbon and nitrogen isotopes and by comparison of the results with other green and obligate myco-heterotrophic species they proved that the plant is able to supply significant proportion of its nutrients demands through the same processes as autotrophic green plants. It is therefore not a true obligate myco-heterotroph but only a partial myco-heterotroph. It probably represent a species \u0026#8216;on its evolutionary way\u0026#8217; from autotrophic to heterotrophic existence, which makes it very special among presently known members of the kingdom of plants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtected according to \u0026#8216;Uredba o zavarovanih prostoživečih rastlinskih vrstah\u0026#8217;\u003cbr /\u003e\nUrl.

Taxonomy of these taxa seems to me messy; to my knowledge no monograph dedicated to this genus is available. Some authors, including Index Fungorum, consider these names as separate species; some consider them as synonyms (for example Breitenbach (1991)). Ref.: 1. considers Melanoleuca subalpina and Melanoleuca evenosa synonyms and Melanoleuca strictipes a separate species. Ref.:3. considers Melanoleuca evenosa and Melanoleuca strictipes as synonyms. In literature data about spore dimensions also contradicts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe find shown corresponds excellently to the description of Melanoleuca subalpina given in Dähncke (2009), hence I decided for it. Since pilei diameters of this observation in average equal or exceed stipe length this should be Melanoleuca alpina and not Melanoleuca strictipes (ss. Ref.4) (assuming both are separate species). However measured spore dimensions of this find do not fit to data given in Dähncke (2009), but they fit well to Breitenbach (1991) and Bresinsky (1977) and also to other sources (assuming Melanoleuca strictipes and Melanoleuca subalpina are synonyms). More and more I value Arora\u0026#8217;s advise that \u0026#8216;\u0026#8230; exact identities of closely related Melanoleuca-s are best left to
