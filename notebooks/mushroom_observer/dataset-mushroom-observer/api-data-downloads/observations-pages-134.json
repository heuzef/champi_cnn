However, under the microscope, the species turned out to be a rather peculiar, cup-shaped basidiomycete. It had been thriving almost the whole January 2014 (the warmest ever measured in Slovenia!) on these logs. The species is not present in the Slovenian fungi check list (Ref.: 1). This surprises because it has been recorded in all surrounding countries and is not considered a very rare one. Surprises also the substratum found. Ref.: 2. states 39 different species of hardwood, however, Juglans regia is not among them. The logs were infected with Ascocorine sarcodes, Trametes sp, and Exidia sp. too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaxonomy of this genus (syn.: Cyphellopsis / Solenia) seems not yet fixed.  Several mycologists agree that it is almost impossible to distinguish among many described species in it. It has already been a member of several genera. In addition, some DNA analysis doesn\u0026#8217;t support presently supposed morphological division into species and speaks more in the direction of a \u0026#8216;cloud\u0026#8217; of highly variable forms probably representing a genus, which is in a vigorous (micro)evolutionary process (Ref.:2). May be this explains a bit too large spores of this observation. Strange enough, based on DNA it’s closely related to gilled mushrooms and is placed in the family Niaceae, which includes, hard believing, salt-water-inhabiting fungi (Ref.:7.). The whole taxonomy story is described in Ref. 5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Canon G11, 6.1-30mm/f2.8-4.5\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":43093,"consensus_name":"Merismodes anomala","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, Posočje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":400819},{"id":158724,"type":"observation","date":"2014-01-04","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.824019,"created_at":"2014-01-27T20:09:48.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-31T01:00:43.000Z","number_of_views":67,"last_viewed":"2023-10-13T06:43:29.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMirrored on iNaturalist as \u003ca href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/164730346\"\u003eobservation 164730346\u003c/a\u003e on May 30, 2023.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":5659,"consensus_id":25535,"consensus_name":"Hydnopolyporus fimbriatus","location_id":150,"location_name":"Cristalino Jungle Lodge, Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso, Brazil","primary_image_id":400830},{"id":158725,"type":"observation","date":"2014-01-04","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.899271,"created_at":"2014-01-27T20:29:41.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-31T01:02:00.000Z","number_of_views":75,"last_viewed":"2023-09-05T14:07:29.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eMirrored on iNaturalist as \u003ca href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/164730484\"\u003eobservation 164730484\u003c/a\u003e on May 30, 2023.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":5659,"consensus_id":180,"consensus_name":"Leucoagaricus","location_id":150,"location_name":"Cristalino Jungle Lodge, Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso, Brazil","primary_image_id":400834},{"id":158726,"type":"observation","date":"2014-01-07","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.41301,"created_at":"2014-01-27T20:43:26.000Z","updated_at":"2015-10-06T03:43:41.000Z","number_of_views":26,"last_viewed":"2023-11-26T09:41:10.000Z","owner_id":1508,"consensus_id":174,"consensus_name":"Lycoperdon pyriforme","location_id":2237,"location_name":"Dalton, Georgia, USA","primary_image_id":400802},{"id":158727,"type":"observation","date":"2014-01-27","latitude":"33.7062","longitude":"-118.0002","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.848894,"created_at":"2014-01-27T21:15:09.000Z","updated_at":"2015-03-09T22:19:31.000Z","number_of_views":45,"last_viewed":"2023-11-26T14:07:18.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eIn the fenced portion of the park\u0026#8217;s garden, heavily shaded on a log.

According to Ref.:(1) the find is too robust There is also some ambiguity in literature regarding similar Rusullas with yellow hut. Among others, this observation can be also Russula acetolens, Rauschert. Both R. risigallina and R. acetolens are sometimes referred under common name R. lutea (Ref.: (2)). Both are supposed to be somewhat smaller in average than this observation. Although measured spore dimensions fit very well to R. risigallina, type of spore surface do hardly. Warts eventually appear too coarse (?) (Refs.:(2) and (3)). Both mentioned alternatives should have distinctly sweet and vinegary smell respectively, but our observation had no distinct smell. Also, Refs.:(4) and (5) disagree with these statements. If I follow Ref.:(5) this observation fits the best to the name Russula risigallina var. acetolens. No really better fit could be found. There is some ambiguity also regarding its taste. Trama and gills (a small piece of the edge of the pileus) certainly didn\u0026#8217;t have distinct, strong burning taste. However, it also was not completely \u0026#8216;mild\u0026#8217; (as it should be for R. risigalina according most sources), but had a barely noticeable bitter/burning taste after a longer chewing being far of that what is usually meant by \u0026#8216;burning taste\u0026#8217; with Russulas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":25342,"consensus_name":"Russula risigallina","location_id":9118,"location_name":"Log pod Mangartom, East Julian Alps, Slovenia","primary_image_id":401414},{"id":158951,"type":"observation","date":"2014-02-01","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.848791,"created_at":"2014-02-01T21:14:25.000Z","updated_at":"2014-02-02T02:16:08.000Z","number_of_views":35,"last_viewed":"2023-08-23T22:46:33.000Z","owner_id":4649,"consensus_id":29053,"consensus_name":"Cordyceps militaris","location_id":7019,"location_name":"Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês, Portugal","primary_image_id":401423},{"id":158952,"type":"observation","date":"2014-02-01","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.912326,"created_at":"2014-02-01T21:34:17.000Z","updated_at":"2014-02-03T18:19:43.000Z","number_of_views":43,"last_viewed":"2024-03-30T02:03:53.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eOn rotten wood.
