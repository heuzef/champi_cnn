the largest lichens of Slovenia. It is the most beautiful after a few rainy days. Then dry it is brownish or dull green, but when moist it becomes shiny green. Since it is very sensitive to air pollution it is in sharp decline in Europe and hence protected in many countries. As such it is used as an indicator of rich, healthy and undisturbed ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLobaria pulmonaria can be quite common in its ideal habitat; however, actually it is quite a rare find nowadays, particularly in low-land industrial countries. It occurs most often in shady environments. Green algae give Lobaria pulmonaria its bright green appearance. The underside of this lichen is whitish with pockets of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). Hence this species is an association of three much different living beings: fungus and two kinds of algae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts main method of reproducing is by tiny granule-like isidia or soredia, which develop on the edges of its talus (Fig. 63), eventually break off and fall on ground or in crevices of three bank, where they can grow into new lichen. Sometimes Lobaria pulmonaria also has spore-producing structures called apothecia that spread fungal spores.
