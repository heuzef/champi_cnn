The largest cap: 2 cm., smooth, dry, with minutely serrated gills; KOH negative on cap. Stipe: off-center, longitudinally ridged, white above the ring zone, 3.5 cm. X 3 mm. at apex and 6 mm. at the impressively enlarged base; solid, white flesh, not discoloring or bruising when sliced. At first I thought maybe a Cortinarius because of the enlarged base and the whispy \u0026#8220;threads\u0026#8221; seen on the cap (remnants of a veil?), but I did NOT get a rusty-brown spore print. The print was creamy-white. I considered that the serrated gills might be just ragged gills due to age, but these mushrooms were not more than a day old; I had checked this mulch bed the day before. So, because of the off-center stipes, the serrated gills, and the creamy-white spore print, I\u0026#8217;m going with Lentinellus, but not very confidently.

It\u0026#8217;s definitely related to this eastern critter; however, I have reservations about it being conspecific, provided that its ITS sequence has been properly edited, particularly at the 5\u0026#8217; and 3\u0026#8217; ends, where most mismatches take place.  A number of AZ boletes tested by Terri Clements showed close genetic affinities to several eastern taxa.  While their ITS sequences are sufficiently different to suggest discrete entities, conspecificity cannot ruled out at this point without testing additional loci.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;\u003c/b\u003e A MUSCLE alignment of all the 6 ITS sequences (see the uploaded file) identifies no fewer than 18 positions featuring single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) events that represent a range of natural variation seen in the genetic make-up of what appears to be a single species distributed across a wide geographical range.  This intraspecific variability is to be expected, as we are likely dealing with isolated populations of this bolete.  However, 2/3 of these mismatches involve ambiguous characters \u0026#8211; i.e., the presence of two possible bases at a specific position in the same organism \u0026#8211; in just 1 or 2 out of 6 sequences per each site.  This means that these differences are of little import, and only a few remaining shared SNP sites matter.  A summary of this information is condensed in the table below.

The red on the cap and stipe was a pure, dark red with no hint of pink or orange.

These colors were distinctly different, but a little less so than observed with the earlier observation. The mushroom had no distinctive smell or flavor (maybe \u0026#8211; maybe \u0026#8211; a lingering \u0026#8220;metallic\u0026#8221; taste).

This is also a distinct difference from the earlier observation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe largest specimen was fully mature but not yet old.

The tube layer does not change its depth significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite mycelium. Stem red all the way up until right near the pores, where it became very yellow. No reticulation. All stems were pillar shaped with the exception of a vague bulge at the bottom for some of the true babies. \u003ci\u003eThis is a very marked contrast to the other bicolor collection today.

Both have been regularly identified as \u0026#8220;bicolors\u0026#8221; but I do not think they are the same species. The red on these is just a little pinker, the stems are uniformly clavate/bulbous, the flesh is much denser, and they react to the dryness with caps that fissure rather than just growing pale. In addition, the tube layers on those were thin (around 2 mm) but the tubes on these are vanishingly tiny (around Â¾ mm) even though these are physically larger.

This is one of those intensely desirable mushrooms that fills your inner chef with greed.

It is easy to recognize it since nothing similar exists outside tropical regions. Because of its bright white color, it is also easy to spot. Its genus name Ceratiomyxa comes from Greek words keras and myxa. The first means horn(s) and the second slime. And indeed it consists (in most cases) of many erects columns made of slimy substance. Unlike of all other myxomycetes the columns bear individual spores externally, on long stalks (see picture 2b, middle-left). However, it can appear also in a much different form, which is treated by some authors as separate species Ceratiomyxa poroides Alb. \u0026amp; Schwein or a subspecies of Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa. Then it looks like spongy, poroid or effused crust, much similar to some poroid basidiomycetes. The plasmodium of Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa is watery translucent (see picture 2a, slime among developed columns). It initially forms whitish blobs (see picture 1b, upper part), which in mature stage develop into simple or sparsely branched columns covered by stalked, white spores looking similar to glandular hairs of higher plants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikon D700/Nikkor Micro 105mm/f2.8 and Canon G11, 6.1-30mm/f2.8-4.5\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":931,"consensus_id":40774,"consensus_name":"Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa var. fruticulosa","location_id":774,"location_name":"Lower Trenta Valley, East Julian Alps, PosoÄje, Slovenia","primary_image_id":635537},{"id":244287,"type":"observation","date":"2016-07-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.55034,"created_at":"2016-07-15T11:21:22.000Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T22:13:18.000Z","number_of_views":44,"last_viewed":"2024-02-23T13:42:21.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eFound growing from decomposing wood in wet eucalyptus forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplete description can be found here\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/23442607\"\u003ehttps://www.shroomery.org/...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":7453,"consensus_id":19953,"consensus_name":"Deconica","location_id":3198,"location_name":"Adelaide Hills, South Australia, Australia","primary_image_id":635544},{"id":244288,"type":"observation","date":"2016-07-15","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":0.830391,"created_at":"2016-07-15T13:09:58.000Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T11:25:51.000Z","number_of_views":32,"last_viewed":"2023-10-13T07:21:21.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eGrowing under hardwoods in the park\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCap yellowish brown, cracked at margin, no staining with Ammonia; tubes decurrent, pale yellow, stains blue weakly when injured; stipe tapered towards the base; flesh whitish yellow, stains blue wealky when cut; basal mycelium white; spores subfusiform, (9.562-)9.73-11.73(-12.965) x (3.977-)4.11-4.79(-4.973) Âµm, Q:1.99-2.76, N:17\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":7286,"consensus_id":902,"consensus_name":"Xerocomus","location_id":11741,"location_name":"Tsukuba, Ibaragi, Japan","primary_image_id":635558},{"id":244289,"type":"observation","date":"2016-07-13","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.39547,"created_at":"2016-07-15T13:13:59.000Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T14:23:01.000Z","number_of_views":65,"last_viewed":"2024-02-17T05:42:58.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eTypical form found in oak-dominated woods.
