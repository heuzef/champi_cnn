Many areas where mold(Trichoderma spp.) had covered the fruiting body in early November(dry spell and record heat) had to be left and I simply cut away freshly groing and healthy tissue.  Heavy freezing fog in the last 3 days was causing these sections that had Trichoderma on them in early growth stages to become soggy and wilted by harvest time.  What a fun and interesting opportunity this year(and many years to come) to monitor this beautiful species in such close proximity to our new home here in Olympia, WA.  I plan to continue an annual monitoring and harvest with each following season of this species- granted another mycophile doesn\u0026#8217;t discover it and pull up the rhizomatous/rooting stem ;).  It\u0026#8217;s amazing to me that the steady growth of this collection continued even with an infestation of mold, record temps/weather and overall odd weather patterns for the season.  A truly resilient and antibiotic rich creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGROWTH UPDATE ON 11/25/17.  Nearly or at full maturity.  The section closest to the substrate(Douglas fir) where I cut a small sample for dehydration a week ago is beginning to discolor to light brown and is waterlogged.  Almost the entire remaining sporophore material is extended and lobes are frilled and fully expanded.  Compare with original images taken on 10/8/17 when the overall fruiting body was compact and un-extended.  Will harvest the entire epigeal section of the fruiting and cook down later this week(never cut Sparassis below soil rooting tissue-to insure re fruiting for multiple coming seasons).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth Update monitored on 11/13/17.  Section where my sample was cut for herbarium/dehydration last week is beginning to \u0026#8220;heal over\u0026#8221; and fronds are expanding throughout the fruiting body.  Constant, heavy rain and colder temps has definitely coaxed the fruiting body to rapid growth and expansion in size.  Trichoderma(mold) that I have been monitoring on the sporophore has depleted and is almost non existent(macroscopically) on the base of the FB.  Will continue monitoring for another week or two before harvest and possibly a cook out.  Images will of course be added for this experience in the near future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth Updated Monitored On 11/9/17-sampled section for herbarium and storage.  Dense fronds expanding, nearing full maturity.  Trichoderma spp. proliferating the base of fruiting body-deterring from collection for the table this season.  Left sclerotium(deep rooting base) of this parasite in tact and undisturbed to return next season/harvest for possible culinary usage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth progress updated: 11/6/17.  Trichoderma locations on fruiting body have stalled growth in this sections infected.  Areas without mold evident have expanded and are still growing and leafing out.  A bit larger than a volleyball at this point.  Will continue monitoring until outer petals have lengthened and taken on the \u0026#8220;egg noodle\u0026#8221; appearance(usually the stage we harvest them).  Will hope to have enough material for a small meal(one of our absolute favorite species for the table) and sample small amounts of material for microscopy and herbarium storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpdated on 10/31/17:  Mold(Trichoderma spp) proliferating the fruiting body.  Will continue monitoring to see how the mold infestation affects the progression and growth to maturity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth Progress UPDATED on 10/19/17:  Multiple images added of growth 11 days after initial observation.  Will continue to monitor until full maturity.  Currently the Sporophore is about the size of a volleyball(initial observation was baseball/softball sized).  Beginning to unfortunately form Trichoderma flushes at the base and on a few of the extending lobes.  Will be fun to see how this works out and if the antibacterial constituents in the Sparassis will over run the blue mold or not.  We will see.  I anticipate that this will be at full maturity by mid December(depending on frost and precipitation).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youngest and freshest collection of S. radicata I have been lucky enough to photograph.
