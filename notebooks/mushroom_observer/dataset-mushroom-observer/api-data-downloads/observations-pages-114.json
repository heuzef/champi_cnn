The hymenium has lots of thick-walled incrusted hyphae in between the basidia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second micto-shot is of spores from the hymenius at 1000x in KOH.  The spores are ellipsoid, smooth, and small.  I looked, but I couldn\u0026#8217;t find any spores attached to basidia, so I don\u0026#8217;t know how many would be on each basidia.  The apr. spore size is 4 \u0026#215; 2 um.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used Fungi Europaeia Corticiaceae.  But I have to say I still couldn\u0026#8217;t get anywhere using the key to genera.  SO, just flipping through the book, I saw that with the small spores and the thick-walled incrusted hyphae are usual features of the genus Steccherinum, along with the teeth on the hymenium.  Then going through the Steccherinum in that book, it seems to id to S. fimbriatum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was only found because things were so sparse and dry up there, that I just started collecting crusts.  And then if there wasn\u0026#8217;t anything else to get to, I would start id\u0026#8217;ing crusts.  This came from a collection of a few shavings from one log, all looked the same.  But this shaving only showed the teeth on the hymenium, and I didn\u0026#8217;t notice that in the field, only once I got back to the lab, and starting photographing these things.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":25108,"consensus_name":"Steccherinum fimbriatum","location_id":27,"location_name":"Bassetts, Sierra Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":340245},{"id":137193,"type":"observation","date":"2013-04-09","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.58978,"created_at":"2013-06-21T20:25:42.000Z","updated_at":"2013-06-21T20:25:48.000Z","number_of_views":38,"last_viewed":"2023-08-17T02:38:39.000Z","owner_id":1093,"consensus_id":29211,"consensus_name":"Scytinostroma portentosum","location_id":7653,"location_name":"Lindberg, Neudorf bei Landsee, Bezirk Oberpullendorf, Burgenland, Austria","primary_image_id":340248},{"id":137194,"type":"observation","date":"2013-06-20","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.58094,"created_at":"2013-06-21T20:58:54.000Z","updated_at":"2013-06-21T20:58:58.000Z","number_of_views":13,"last_viewed":"2023-09-13T21:57:04.000Z","owner_id":369,"consensus_id":439,"consensus_name":"Cryptoporus volvatus","location_id":887,"location_name":"Cook Forest State Park, Pennsylvania, USA","primary_image_id":340254},{"id":137195,"type":"observation","date":"2013-04-09","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":true,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":2.58978,"created_at":"2013-06-21T21:50:37.000Z","updated_at":"2013-06-21T21:50:42.000Z","number_of_views":75,"last_viewed":"2024-03-06T18:42:53.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003ealso in WU?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is now in Resupinatus but I still retain the genus.

But the day before was rainy which would have also impacted on the appearance.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAlso, the first 5 photos were taken in sunlight but with flash.
