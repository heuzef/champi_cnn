Because of some doubts in this determination the location has been revisited and new pilei collected (see Obs. no. 257921). Pilei cuticle shows a hymenophore appearance with erect hyphae composed of ± inflated cells as the most important distinguishing trait for Hemileccinum depilatum (Ref.:2). Also, almost certain mycorrhizal relation with Ostrya carpinifolia (Ref.: 3) (no other grown up trees in the vicinity), calcareous ground and other traits fit well to the descriptions of this fungus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDescription: Two pilei growing together, almost confluent at the base; diameter 15 cm and 5.2 cm, tubes length 15 mm and 10 mm, context thick 23 mm and 12 mm respectively; stipe length 10 cm with 2.3 cm max diameter and 10.5 cm and 2.3 cm diameter respectively, tapering into a rooting base; smell almost absent or very mild, not unpleasant; taste mild, pleasant, a little bit mucous; tubes somewhat bruising darker when pressed on the older pileus; flesh when cut not bruising (also not on the young pileus, which contradicts to Ref.: 8); pilei surface and pore layer barely noticeably sticking when touched (in dry weather).

However, some properties are very unusual, if possible at all, for this determination: the mushroom\u0026#8217;s substratum doesn\u0026#8217;t seem to be wood, color of the pilei may be still OK (although no violet tint at all observed) but spore print is not white (or pale crème) as according to literature but distinctly ocher-hazel-nut color and spores seem a bit too wide. The mushroom(s) grew from a crack of a larger, mostly buried calcareous rock. There was no wooden stump in the vicinity. The crack was 1-1.5 cm wide and filled with humus and some small (max 4 mm in diameter) roots possibly of neighboring dead Picea abies or several Fagus sylvatica trees surrounding the place. I dug about 30 cm deep around the crack and surrounding soil, but there was no massive wood buried at the place (picture 18 shows the crack where the mushrooms were growing).
