It came in and it was rather large, pileus ~14 cm across, ~5 cm thick.  But the feel of the mushroom, was different than anyone we found before.  Only the pores stain blue, not the pileus or stipe.  And later when I cut in half, the flesh did not stain blue when bruised.  Only the flesh near the pores very slowly slightly stained blue.  The taste of the flesh was very mild.  One interesting feature, there was a layer of brick/vineasous red under the pileapelus (how do I spell that?).  You can see a little of this in the photo where there are a few nips out of the edges of the pileus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe species of B. smithii was roughly placed up at Albion, and I took these home to look at the Boletus of CA. online:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mykoweb.com/boletes/index.html\"\u003ehttp://mykoweb.com/boletes/index.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the field key, B. spadiceus seemed to match these.  It does have the red layer in the cap, and the slightly bluing near to the pores only.  But these are too large for the description, and the red on the stipe is not mentioned.  Also B. fragrans comes close, it better matches size, and has the red on the stipe, but not the red layer in the cap.  Also B. fragrans is listed as only a montane species, that has only rearely been found.  So, none of these are really satisfactory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut going back to B. smithii, the description does match these rather well, with the red layer in the cap, and esp. with the rad band at the top of the stipe.  But smithii is supposed to blue stain in the flesh, and these didn\u0026#8217;t do that much.  But I was cutting it up 24 hours later, and in other species the blue staining can go away after getting the sample out of ground, so don\u0026#8217;t know.  Also I am used to crysenteron, where the amount of bluing in the flesh is quite variable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one place the field key went a little wrong with these, was that they are supposed to have a red/pinkish cap.  In the comments it does mention that they are usually olive/brown/gray in the cap, but this layer wears off as the species grows and the under red layer starts to show through, giving them a pinkish/red cap look.  These are fresh enough to not quite show the red layer in the cap very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe description also mentions that these are more common in Oregon and Washington area, but are common enough in the coastal area of CA in Mendocino Co under conifers, but nowhere else in CA.

They were not visid at all anywhere, the cap are probably hygrophanous, but I didn\u0026#8217;t verify that.  The contina seems to have complete gone away on the stipe, but there seems to have been a universal veil, there are brown veil remenants on the cap edges, and the bottom of the stipes are wooly white with veil remenants.  Kinda neat little guys, found in the duff of a redwood grove.  But no idea about the species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeb 23, 2007 \u0026#8211; I just got \u0026#8220;Mushrooms and other fungi of North America\u0026#8221; by Roger Phillips, and I look at the cover, and I think, hey that it my little cort. with wooly stipe right there.  I look inside, and it take a little looking, but I find that on the cover is C. evernius.  Which it turns out is described in Arora also.  The description actually matches well, with the veil remnants on the cap edge, and the white wooly veil on the stipe.  But I had dismissed it do to the size of the cap, and the stalk description says it is equal or narrowed to the base.  This better matches the photos in Phillips.  These seem to be too small, and the stalks are wider at the base.  But the photos do look similar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the comments for C. evernius Arora mention C. lucorum as a common conifer lover which differs with a club shaped stem.  These are under D. fir and Redwood, and mostly club shaped, so I will go with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeb. 24, 2007 \u0026#8212; after looking over a google search on C. lucorum, these do look very close, but the photos I found have an abrupt bulb at the base, where these are more smoothly club shaped.  I guess I should just go for the main species in Arora first, before heading to the notes, if I really just can\u0026#8217;t tell the difference here.  I\u0026#8217;m calling these C. evernius, although they could be C. lucorum, or C. saturinius which is a similar European species that has been seen (maybe) in Oregon.\u003c/p\u003e","owner_id":25,"consensus_id":1011,"consensus_name":"Cortinarius evernius","location_id":1,"location_name":"Albion, Mendocino Co., California, USA","primary_image_id":1793},{"id":1607,"type":"observation","date":"2006-12-09","gps_hidden":false,"specimen_available":false,"is_collection_location":true,"confidence":1.69149,"created_at":"2006-12-17T23:38:57.000Z","updated_at":"2006-12-18T00:03:06.000Z","number_of_views":30,"last_viewed":"2024-01-20T21:54:10.000Z","notes":"\u003cp\u003eA nice little, really little Lepiota here.

The caps are yellowish and covered with a dense tomentose layer that clumps into dark brown tipped scale-like clusters. The gills and spores are white. The gill edges are broadly wavy but not serrate. The gills are quite wide and thick. The entire caps are dense, thick (up to 3�? at the lateral stipe attach point) with very thick, firm, white flesh. The taste and odor are mild. The caps are large \u0026#8211; up to 9�? across. I am drying some chunks of this in case it turns out to be something interesting. It certainly appears to be an aberrant oyster mushroom except it does not fit the usual characteristics at all. Besides the growth habitat on pine and the tomentose/scaly cap, the fruiting bodies are much more robust and thick-fleshed than other oysters I\u0026#8217;ve seen, even ones of the same size.
