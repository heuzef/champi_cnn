mobilenet_v2 = "https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4"
base_model = hub.KerasLayer(mobilenet_v2, input_shape=(224, 224, 3), trainable=False)

# Build your custom model on top of the pre-trained base
model = models.Sequential([
    base_model,
    layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

============================================================
=============Fine tuning ====================================

To further fine-tune your model after unfreezing some layers and training for a few epochs, you can follow these steps:

1. Gradual Unfreezing and Training
Instead of unfreezing a fixed number of layers (fine_tune_at = 100), you can gradually unfreeze more layers and observe if it improves performance. This approach allows you to find the optimal balance between using pre-trained features and adapting to your specific dataset.

python
Copier le code
# Example of gradual unfreezing and further fine-tuning

# Unfreeze more layers gradually
for layer in base_model.layers[:-10]:  # Unfreeze all layers except the last 10 layers
    layer.trainable = False

# Recompile the model after changing trainable attributes
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-6),  # Lower the learning rate for fine-tuning
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Continue training
history_fine = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=train_generator.samples // train_generator.batch_size,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=validation_generator.samples // validation_generator.batch_size,
    epochs=10  # Increase epochs or until validation metrics stabilize/improve
)
2. Adjust Learning Rate
Fine-tuning typically requires smaller learning rates to prevent drastic changes to the learned features from the pre-trained model. You can experiment with different learning rates to find the optimal one for your dataset:

python
Copier le code
# Example of adjusting learning rate during fine-tuning

# Compile the model with a different learning rate
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-6),  # Adjust learning rate as needed
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Continue training with the new learning rate
history_fine = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=train_generator.samples // train_generator.batch_size,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=validation_generator.samples // validation_generator.batch_size,
    epochs=10
)
3. Regularization Techniques
Apply regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting during fine-tuning:

python
Copier le code
# Example of adding dropout regularization

from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout

# Add Dropout layer after Dense layer
model = models.Sequential([
    base_model,
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),  # Dropout for regularization
    layers.Dense(train_generator.num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-6),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Continue training with regularization
history_fine = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=train_generator.samples // train_generator.batch_size,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=validation_generator.samples // validation_generator.batch_size,
    epochs=10
)
4. Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitor the training and validation metrics (accuracy and loss) closely after each fine-tuning step. Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

Summary
Fine-tuning involves experimenting with unfreezing more layers, adjusting learning rates, applying regularization techniques, and carefully monitoring performance metrics. The goal is to optimize the model for your specific task while leveraging the pre-trained features from ResNet50. 
Adjustments should be made iteratively based on the observed performance on both training and validation datasets.
